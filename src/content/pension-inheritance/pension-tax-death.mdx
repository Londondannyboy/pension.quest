## The Two Key Taxes

<DataTable
  title="Taxes on Death"
  columns={[
    { key: "tax", header: "Tax Type" },
    { key: "applies", header: "Applies to Pension?", highlight: true },
    { key: "notes", header: "Notes" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { tax: "Inheritance Tax (IHT)", applies: "Usually NO", notes: "Pension outside your estate" },
    { tax: "Income Tax", applies: "Depends", notes: "Based on age at death" }
  ]}
/>

## Inheritance Tax: Usually Exempt

<Callout type="info" title="Pensions Outside Your Estate">
Pensions are held in trust by your pension provider. This means:
- They don't form part of your estate
- They don't count towards the £325,000 IHT threshold
- No 40% inheritance tax applies

This makes pensions one of the most tax-efficient assets to pass on.
</Callout>

## Death Before 75: Tax-Free Rules

<DataTable
  title="Tax-Free Inheritance (Death <75)"
  columns={[
    { key: "option", header: "Beneficiary Option" },
    { key: "tax", header: "Tax Due", highlight: true },
    { key: "condition", header: "Condition" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { option: "Lump sum", tax: "£0", condition: "Designated within 2 years" },
    { option: "Drawdown", tax: "£0 on all withdrawals", condition: "Designated within 2 years" },
    { option: "Annuity", tax: "£0 on income", condition: "Set up within 2 years" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="The 2-Year Rule">
For tax-free treatment, the pension scheme must designate benefits within **2 years** of death. Keep your nomination form updated to ensure this happens smoothly.

If missed, income tax applies as if you'd died after 75.
</Callout>

## Tax-Efficient Strategies

### Strategy 1: Spread Withdrawals

<Callout type="example" title="Spreading Over Time">
**£300,000 inherited pension, beneficiary earns £30,000**

**Option A: Lump sum**
- Total income: £330,000
- Tax on pension: ~£125,000
- Net received: ~£175,000

**Option B: £25,000/year over 12 years**
- Annual income: £55,000
- Tax on pension: ~£6,000/year
- Total tax: ~£72,000
- Net received: ~£228,000

**Spreading saves ~£53,000**
</Callout>

### Strategy 2: Use Low-Income Years

<DataTable
  title="Timing Withdrawals"
  columns={[
    { key: "beneficiary", header: "Beneficiary Situation" },
    { key: "strategy", header: "Strategy", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { beneficiary: "High earner", strategy: "Take minimum, leave invested" },
    { beneficiary: "Non-earner", strategy: "Withdraw up to £12,570 tax-free" },
    { beneficiary: "Retired", strategy: "Supplement low-tax income" },
    { beneficiary: "Between jobs", strategy: "Withdraw more in gap year" }
  ]}
/>

### Strategy 3: Multiple Beneficiaries

<Callout type="tip" title="Split for Tax Efficiency">
Nominating multiple beneficiaries means each uses their own tax allowances:

**Two children inherit £200,000 each:**
- Each can withdraw £12,570/year tax-free
- Combined: £25,140/year tax-free
- Much more tax-efficient than one person inheriting £400,000

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is there any inheritance tax on pensions?",
      answer: "Usually no. Pensions are held in trust outside your estate and don't count towards the £325,000 IHT threshold. However, if benefits are paid to your estate (rather than nominated beneficiaries), IHT may apply."
    },
    {
      question: "What tax do beneficiaries pay on inherited pensions?",
      answer: "Death before 75: usually nothing (tax-free). Death after 75: income tax at their marginal rate when they withdraw money."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I leave pension to avoid inheritance tax?",
      answer: "Pensions can be very tax-efficient for inheritance. Spending other assets (ISAs, property, savings) in retirement while preserving your pension means more passes tax-efficiently."
    },
    {
      question: "What about the lifetime allowance?",
      answer: "The lifetime allowance was abolished from April 2024. There are no longer any lifetime allowance charges on pension death benefits."
