Understanding your **pension transfer value** helps you make informed decisions about your retirement savings.

## DC Pension Transfer Value

<Callout type="info" title="DC Transfer Value = Pot Value">
For defined contribution pensions, your transfer value is simply the current value of your pension pot, minus any exit fees.

**Example:** £50,000 pot - £100 exit fee = **£49,900 transfer value**
</Callout>

## DB Pension Transfer Value (CETV)

    { aspect: "Who calculates it?", explanation: "Scheme actuary using complex assumptions" },
    { aspect: "How long valid?", explanation: "3 months from calculation date" },
    { aspect: "Is it guaranteed?", explanation: "Only for the guarantee period" }

## What Affects DB Transfer Value?

<DataTable
  title="Factors Affecting CETV"
  columns={[
    { key: "factor", header: "Factor" },
    { key: "effect", header: "Effect on CETV", highlight: true }

  data={[
    { factor: "Interest rates rise", effect: "CETV falls" },

    { factor: "Your age (older)", effect: "CETV usually falls" },
    { factor: "Scheme funding level", effect: "May affect CETV" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Transfer Values Have Fallen">
DB transfer values peaked in 2021-2022 when interest rates were near zero. Since rates rose sharply in 2022-2023, transfer values have fallen by 30-50% from their peaks.

A pension worth a £500,000 transfer in 2021 might be worth £250,000-350,000 now.

## CETV vs Annuity Comparison

<Callout type="example" title="Value Comparison">
**Your DB pension:** £15,000/year for life with inflation protection

**CETV offered:** £330,000 (22x multiple)

**What would £330,000 buy in annuity?**
- Single life, level annuity: ~£18,000/year
- Joint life, inflation-linked: ~£10,000/year

The DB pension provides ~£15,000/year inflation-linked with spouse pension - better than what you could buy with the CETV.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How often can I request a CETV?",
      answer: "You're entitled to one free CETV per year from each DB scheme. Additional quotes may incur a charge."
    },
    {
      question: "Why did my transfer value go down?",
      answer: "DB transfer values are heavily influenced by interest rates and gilt yields. When rates rise, transfer values fall. This happened significantly in 2022-2023."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a high transfer value a good reason to transfer?",
      answer: "Not necessarily. A high CETV might seem attractive, but you're still giving up valuable guaranteed income. The CETV reflects the cost to replicate your benefits, not whether transfer is right for you."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my scheme reduce my transfer value?",
      answer: "Yes. If a scheme is underfunded, trustees can reduce CETVs. Some schemes have also suspended transfers entirely in times of market stress."
