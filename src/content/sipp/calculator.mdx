## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much should I put in my SIPP?",
      answer: "A common rule is 'half your age as a percentage' - so starting at 30, aim for 15% of income. Maximum is £60,000/year or 100% of earnings (whichever is lower)."
    },
    {
      question: "What growth rate should I assume?",
      answer: "For planning, 4-5% after fees is reasonable for a balanced portfolio. Be conservative - it's better to be pleasantly surprised than disappointed."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I calculate tax relief?",
      answer: "For every £80 you contribute, the SIPP provider claims £20 (basic rate). Higher-rate taxpayers can claim another £20 per £100 gross via self-assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include employer pension in calculations?",
      answer: "Keep them separate but add them for your total picture. Workplace pension for employer match, SIPP for additional savings and control."
    }
