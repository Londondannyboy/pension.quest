## Death Before Age 75

<Callout type="info" title="Tax-Free Inheritance">
If you die before 75 and benefits are paid within 2 years:
- Lump sum: **Tax-free**
- Drawdown: **Tax-free withdrawals**
- Annuity purchase: **Tax-free income**

This applies to defined contribution pensions (workplace DC, SIPPs, personal pensions).
</Callout>

## Death After Age 75

<DataTable
  title="Tax on Inherited Pension (Death After 75)"
  columns={[
    { key: "option", header: "Beneficiary Takes" },
    { key: "tax", header: "Tax Treatment", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { option: "Lump sum", tax: "Added to income, taxed at marginal rate" },
    { option: "Drawdown withdrawals", tax: "Taxed as income when withdrawn" },
    { option: "Annuity income", tax: "Taxed as income" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Example: Inheriting After 75">
**Dad dies at 78** with £200,000 in his SIPP.

**Daughter inherits:**
- Takes £20,000/year via drawdown
- Pays income tax on the £20,000
- If she earns £35,000 from work, total income = £55,000
- Tax due on pension: Basic rate (20%) on most, some at 40%

**Alternative:** She could leave it invested tax-free and only pay tax when withdrawing.
</Callout>

## Your Nomination Form

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: Update Your Nomination">
Your pension doesn't automatically pass via your will. You must complete a **nomination form** with your pension provider naming your beneficiaries.

**Without a nomination:**
- Provider decides who inherits (discretionary)
- Could go to people you didn't intend
- Delays in payment
</Callout>

  title="Nomination Checklist"
  columns={[
    { key: "action", header: "Action" },

  data={[
    { action: "Complete nomination form", when: "When you join a pension" },

## Defined Benefit Pension Inheritance

DB pensions work differently:

<DataTable
  title="DB Pension Death Benefits"
  columns={[
    { key: "scenario", header: "Scenario" },
    { key: "benefit", header: "Typical Benefit", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scenario: "Death before retirement", benefit: "Lump sum (2-4x salary) + spouse pension" },
    { scenario: "Death after retirement", benefit: "Spouse pension (50-66% of your pension)" },
    { scenario: "Unmarried/no civil partner", benefit: "Often nothing (check scheme rules)" },
    { scenario: "Children under 23", benefit: "May receive children's pension" }
  ]}
/>

## State Pension Inheritance

<DataTable
  title="State Pension on Death"
  columns={[
    { key: "type", header: "State Pension Type" },
    { key: "inherit", header: "Can Spouse Inherit?", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { type: "New State Pension (post-2016)", inherit: "Limited - only extra payments above £221.20/week" },
    { type: "Basic State Pension (pre-2016)", inherit: "Yes - up to £169.50/week" },
    { type: "SERPS/S2P (if applicable)", inherit: "Yes - up to 50%" }

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Does my pension go through probate?",
      answer: "Usually no. Pensions are held in trust and pass outside your estate, based on your nomination form. This also means they're usually inheritance tax-free."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I leave my pension to my children?",
      answer: "For DC pensions, yes - you can nominate anyone. For DB pensions, usually only spouse/civil partner can receive ongoing benefits, though children may get short-term payments."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I haven't nominated anyone?",
      answer: "The pension trustees decide who inherits. They'll usually prioritise spouse, then children, then other family. But it's at their discretion - always complete a nomination."
    },
    {
      question: "Is inherited pension subject to inheritance tax?",
      answer: "Usually no. Pensions are held in trust outside your estate, so they don't count towards the inheritance tax threshold."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my unmarried partner inherit my pension?",
      answer: "DC pensions: Yes, if you nominate them. DB pensions: Check scheme rules - some include cohabiting partners, many don't."
    }
