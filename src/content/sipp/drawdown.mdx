**SIPP drawdown** lets you take flexible income from your pension while keeping the rest invested. Here's how it works.

## How Drawdown Works

### Step 1: Crystallise Your Pension

When you access your pension:
1. Move money into drawdown
2. Take 25% tax-free if wanted
3. Rest becomes "crystallised" for income

### Step 2: Take Income

    { key: "method", header: "Method" },
    { key: "details", header: "Details", highlight: true }

  data={[
    { method: "Regular income", details: "Monthly/annual payments you set" },

    { method: "Natural income", details: "Take dividends/interest only" },
    { method: "Combination", details: "Mix of the above" }
  ]}
/>

### Step 3: Keep Investing

Your remaining pot stays invested and can:
- Continue growing (or falling)
- Be adjusted based on your needs
- Pass to beneficiaries on death

<Callout type="warning" title="Watch Your Tax Band">
Large withdrawals could push you into a higher tax band. Spreading withdrawals across tax years can be more tax-efficient.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I take all my SIPP at once?",
      answer: "Yes, but only 25% is tax-free. The rest would be taxed as income, likely pushing you into higher tax bands. Usually not advisable."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my SIPP when I die?",
      answer: "It can pass to beneficiaries. If you die before 75, it's usually tax-free. After 75, beneficiaries pay income tax on withdrawals."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I still invest after starting drawdown?",
      answer: "Yes, your SIPP remains invested. You can still choose and change investments. New contributions may be limited to £10,000/year (Money Purchase Annual Allowance)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop and restart drawdown?",
      answer: "Yes, drawdown is flexible. You can take income, stop, then start again as needed."
    }
