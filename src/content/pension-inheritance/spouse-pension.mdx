What your **spouse** or **civil partner** inherits from your pension depends on the type of pension you have.

## Defined Contribution (DC) Pensions

<DataTable
  title="DC Pension Spouse Inheritance"
  columns={[
    { key: "scenario", header: "When You Die" },
    { key: "inherit", header: "What Spouse Receives", highlight: true },
    { key: "tax", header: "Tax" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scenario: "Before age 75", inherit: "Full remaining pot", tax: "Tax-free" },
    { scenario: "After age 75", inherit: "Full remaining pot", tax: "Income tax on withdrawals" },
    { scenario: "In drawdown", inherit: "Remaining drawdown fund", tax: "Depends on your age at death" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Full Pot Passes">
With DC pensions (including workplace pensions and SIPPs), your spouse can inherit your **entire remaining pension pot** - not just a percentage. They then choose how to access it.
</Callout>

## Defined Benefit (DB) Pensions

<DataTable
  title="DB Pension Spouse Benefits"
  columns={[
    { key: "benefit", header: "Benefit" },
    { key: "typical", header: "Typical Amount", highlight: true },
    { key: "duration", header: "How Long" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { benefit: "Spouse pension", typical: "50% of your pension", duration: "Rest of their life" },
    { benefit: "Some schemes", typical: "66.67% of your pension", duration: "Rest of their life" },
    { benefit: "Death before retirement", typical: "Lump sum + spouse pension", duration: "Varies by scheme" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Example: DB Spouse Pension">
**John has a final salary pension paying £24,000/year.** He dies at 72.

**His wife Sarah receives:**
- Spouse pension: 50% × £24,000 = **£12,000/year**
- This is paid for the rest of Sarah's life
- It may increase with inflation (check scheme rules)
- It's taxed as Sarah's income
</Callout>

### Pre-1997 Service Issues

<Callout type="warning" title="Check Pre-1997 Service">
Some DB schemes don't provide spouse benefits for service before 1997 (or sometimes 1988). This can significantly reduce what your spouse receives. Check your scheme documentation.

## State Pension Inheritance

<DataTable
  title="State Pension for Surviving Spouses"
  columns={[
    { key: "type", header: "State Pension Type" },
    { key: "inherit", header: "Can Spouse Inherit?", highlight: true },
    { key: "amount", header: "How Much" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { type: "New State Pension (reached SPA after 2016)", inherit: "Limited", amount: "Only 'protected payments' above £221.20/week" },
    { type: "Basic State Pension (reached SPA before 2016)", inherit: "Yes", amount: "Up to £169.50/week" },
    { type: "SERPS/S2P", inherit: "Yes", amount: "Up to 50% of their entitlement" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="New State Pension Rules">
Under the new State Pension, inheritance is very limited. Your spouse can only inherit any "protected payments" you had above £221.20/week. For most people, there's little to inherit.
</Callout>

## Civil Partners vs Married Couples

<DataTable
  title="Civil Partner Rights"
  columns={[
    { key: "pension", header: "Pension Type" },
    { key: "rights", header: "Civil Partner Rights", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { pension: "DC pensions", rights: "Same as spouse" },
    { pension: "DB pensions (post-2005)", rights: "Same as spouse" },
    { pension: "DB pensions (pre-2005 service)", rights: "Check scheme - may be limited" },
    { pension: "State Pension", rights: "Same as spouse" }
  ]}
/>

## Unmarried Partners

<Callout type="warning" title="Unmarried Partners at Risk">
If you're not married or in a civil partnership, your partner may have **limited or no automatic rights** to your pension.

**DC pensions:** Nominate your partner on your nomination form - they can inherit the full pot.

**DB pensions:** Many schemes now include "cohabiting partners" but rules vary. Check your scheme. Some require a minimum cohabitation period (often 2 years).

**State Pension:** No inheritance rights for unmarried partners.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Does my spouse automatically get my pension?",
      answer: "For DC pensions, only if you've nominated them. For DB pensions, spouse benefits are usually automatic for married couples and civil partners. State Pension has very limited spouse inheritance."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm separated but not divorced?",
      answer: "Legally, you're still married. For DB pensions, your spouse may still be entitled to spouse benefits unless the scheme says otherwise. For DC pensions, check your nomination form - your estranged spouse may still be nominated."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my ex-spouse claim my pension?",
      answer: "Possibly. Pension sharing orders during divorce can give your ex-spouse a share of your pension. For DB pensions, some schemes still pay spouse pension to ex-spouses in certain circumstances."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does my spouse receive the pension?",
      answer: "For DB spouse pensions: for the rest of their life. For DC pensions: until the pot runs out (they control withdrawals). State Pension inherited elements are ongoing."
