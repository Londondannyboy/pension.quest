    { key: "option", header: "How Beneficiary Takes It" },
    { key: "tax", header: "Tax Treatment", highlight: true }

<Callout type="info" title="No Inheritance Tax">
Good news: even though income tax applies, the pension is still **outside your estate**. It doesn't count towards the £325,000 inheritance tax threshold.

## Lump Sum vs Drawdown: Tax Impact

<Callout type="example" title="Example: £200,000 Inherited Pension">
**Mum dies at 78** leaving £200,000 SIPP to daughter Emma (earning £40,000/year).

**Option 1: Take lump sum**
- Emma's income: £40,000 + £200,000 = £240,000
- Tax on £200,000: ~£82,000 (40% on most, 45% on portion above £125k)
- Emma receives: ~£118,000 after tax

**Option 2: Use drawdown**
- Emma takes £20,000/year over 10 years
- Her income: £40,000 + £20,000 = £60,000/year
- Tax on £20,000: ~£5,000/year (20% basic + 40% on £9,730)
- Total tax over 10 years: ~£50,000
- **Emma keeps £150,000**

**Drawdown saves Emma ~£32,000 in tax.**

<Callout type="tip" title="Consider Multiple Nominees">
If you nominate multiple beneficiaries (e.g., two children), each can use their own tax-free allowance and lower tax bands. This can significantly reduce the overall tax paid.

## Passing Pension to Next Generation

<Callout type="info" title="Multi-Generational Pensions">
If your beneficiary doesn't need the money, they can leave it invested and pass it to their own beneficiaries when they die. If they die before 75, it passes tax-free. If after 75, it's taxed at the next beneficiary's rate.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is there any way to avoid the income tax?",
      answer: "No, but you can minimise it. Using drawdown and spreading withdrawals over years keeps more income in lower tax bands. A non-earning beneficiary can withdraw £12,570/year tax-free."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my beneficiary is a child?",
      answer: "Children can inherit pensions and have their own personal allowance. However, pension income doesn't count as 'parental income' for tax purposes if paid directly to the child."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the pension count for inheritance tax?",
      answer: "Usually no. Pensions are held in trust outside your estate. However, if you transferred funds into a pension when in poor health specifically to avoid IHT, HMRC may challenge this."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I reduce tax by dying before 75?",
      answer: "The tax rules are what they are - you can't control when you die. But if you're in poor health before 75, it may be worth leaving pension untouched rather than drawing it down."
