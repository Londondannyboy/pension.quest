<Callout type="warning" title="Check Before Transferring">
Don't transfer if:
- You'd lose valuable benefits (guaranteed annuity rates, protected tax-free cash)
- Exit fees would significantly reduce your pot
- The new provider has higher charges
- You're close to retirement and don't need to change
- It's a DB pension (usually best to keep)

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my pension myself?",
      answer: "For DC to DC transfers, yes - you usually initiate through your new provider. For DB transfers over £30k, you must receive regulated financial advice first."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I pay tax on a pension transfer?",
      answer: "No, pension-to-pension transfers are tax-free. Tax only applies when you withdraw money from your pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer a pension I'm already taking?",
      answer: "Sometimes yes - if you're in drawdown, you can often transfer to another provider. Annuities cannot usually be transferred once purchased."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my investments during transfer?",
      answer: "Usually, investments are sold and transferred as cash, then reinvested. Some providers offer 'in-specie' transfer keeping investments as they are."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my employer stop me transferring my workplace pension?",
      answer: "No. You have the legal right to transfer your pension to another provider. However, you may lose employer contributions if you transfer an active scheme."
