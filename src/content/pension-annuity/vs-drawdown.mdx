## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I have both annuity and drawdown?",
      answer: "Yes! Many people use an annuity for guaranteed baseline income and drawdown for flexible extras. You can also start with drawdown and buy an annuity later."
    },
    {
      question: "Which gives more income?",
      answer: "Initially, annuity often gives more (especially at older ages). But drawdown pot can grow, potentially giving more over time. There's no definitive answer - it depends on how long you live and investment returns."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch between them?",
      answer: "You can switch from drawdown to annuity anytime. But once you buy an annuity, you can't switch back - it's permanent."
