A **workplace pension** is a retirement savings scheme set up by your employer. Since 2012, most UK workers are automatically enrolled into one. This guide explains how workplace pensions work and how to make the most of yours.

## What is a Workplace Pension?

A workplace pension is a defined contribution (DC) scheme arranged by your employer. You and your employer both pay into it, and the money is invested to grow over time for your retirement.

## Auto-Enrolment Explained

Since 2012, employers must automatically enrol eligible workers into a workplace pension. This is called **auto-enrolment**.

### Who Gets Auto-Enrolled?

### Many Employers Pay More

While 3% is the legal minimum, many employers contribute more:

    { key: "employer", header: "Employer Pays", highlight: true },

    { type: "Generous scheme", employer: "10%+", employee: "5%", example: "£3,500 + £1,750" }
  ]}

<Callout type="tip" title="Free Money!">
If your employer matches contributions, always contribute enough to get the full match - it's free money! Not doing so is like leaving part of your salary on the table.

## How Your Money Grows

Your workplace pension contributions are invested in funds chosen by you or defaulted by your scheme.

  subtitle="£200/month with 5% employer match over 30 years"
  data={[
    { label: "Your contributions", value: 72000, color: "bg-blue-500" },

    { label: "Investment growth", value: 156000, color: "bg-violet-500" }

- **After 35 years** (5% growth): **~£330,000**
- **Your contributions alone**: £61,320
- **Growth multiplier**: 5.4x your money!

## Should You Opt Out?

You can opt out of your workplace pension within one month of being enrolled. But consider this carefully.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Opt In vs Opt Out"
  columns={[
    { key: "in", header: "Stay In", highlight: true },
    { key: "out", header: "Opt Out" }
  ]}
  rows={[
    { feature: "Employer contributions", values: { in: "You get them (free money)", out: "You lose them completely" } },
    { feature: "Tax relief", values: { in: "Government tops up contributions", out: "None" } },
    { feature: "Take-home pay", values: { in: "Slightly lower", out: "Slightly higher" } },
    { feature: "Retirement savings", values: { in: "Building for future", out: "Nothing saved" } },
    { feature: "Re-enrolment", values: { in: "Already in", out: "Employer will re-enrol every 3 years" } }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Think Twice Before Opting Out">
Opting out means losing:
- Free employer contributions (3%+ of your salary)
- Tax relief on contributions (20-45% depending on tax rate)
- Years of investment growth

For most people, these benefits far outweigh the small increase in take-home pay.

2. **Buy an annuity** - Guaranteed income for life
3. **Use drawdown** - Flexible withdrawals
4. **Take it all** - Cash out entirely (tax implications)
5. **Leave it invested** - Continue growing

## Changing Jobs

When you leave an employer, your pension doesn't disappear:

    { option: "Consolidate old pensions", pros: "Simpler, clearer picture", cons: "Check for exit fees first" }

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What is the minimum employer pension contribution?",
      answer: "Employers must contribute at least 3% of qualifying earnings (earnings between £6,240 and £50,270). Many employers voluntarily pay more, especially with contribution matching schemes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I opt out of my workplace pension?",
      answer: "Yes, you can opt out within one month of being enrolled to get a full refund. After that, you can still leave but may have built up some benefits. Remember, opting out means losing free employer contributions."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my pension if I leave my job?",
      answer: "Your pension stays invested with the provider. You can leave it there, transfer it to your new employer's scheme, or move it to a personal pension like a SIPP."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my workplace pension protected if my employer goes bust?",
      answer: "Yes. Workplace pensions are held separately from company assets by trustees or insurance companies. Your money is protected even if your employer fails."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pay more into my workplace pension?",
      answer: "Yes! You can usually increase your contributions through payroll. This is often the most tax-efficient way to save as you get tax relief automatically and may get additional employer matching."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a workplace pension and a personal pension?",
      answer: "A workplace pension is set up by your employer who must contribute. A personal pension you set up yourself with no employer involvement. Both have the same tax benefits, but workplace pensions come with free employer money."
