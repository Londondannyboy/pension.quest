## Transfer Process

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open a SIPP** with your chosen provider
2. **Request transfer** through the new provider
3. **Complete paperwork** (often online)
4. **Old provider sells investments** and sends cash
5. **New provider receives funds** (typically 4-8 weeks)
6. **You reinvest** in your chosen funds

During transfer, your money is typically held as cash for several weeks. You miss any market gains (or losses) during this period.

## FAQs

  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long does a pension transfer take?",
      answer: "Typically 4-8 weeks, though it can take longer for complex pensions or if paperwork issues arise."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to sell my investments?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer a pension I'm still paying into?",
      answer: "Generally not while still employed with that company. You'd transfer after leaving or when you stop contributions."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum to transfer?",
      answer: "Some SIPP providers have minimums (e.g., £1,000-5,000). Very small pots may be better left or cashed out."
