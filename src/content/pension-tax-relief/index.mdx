**Pension tax relief** is one of the best incentives to save for retirement. The government effectively tops up your pension contributions.

## How Tax Relief Works

<Callout type="info" title="The Basic Idea">
When you contribute to a pension, you don't pay income tax on that money. This means:

- **Basic rate taxpayers:** Contribute £80, pension gets £100 (provider adds 20%)
- **Higher rate taxpayers:** Contribute £80, pension gets £100, plus reclaim £20 via self-assessment
- **Additional rate taxpayers:** Contribute £80, pension gets £100, plus reclaim £25 via self-assessment

## Salary Sacrifice

<Callout type="info" title="Extra Savings">
With **salary sacrifice**, you give up salary in exchange for employer pension contributions. You save:
- Income tax
- National Insurance (both employee and employer)

Example: £100 salary sacrifice at 40% tax saves £40 tax + £12 NI = £52. Cost to you: just £48.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do I get tax relief automatically?",
      answer: "Basic rate relief (20%) is automatic for personal pensions. Higher rate relief must be claimed via self-assessment. Workplace pensions using 'net pay' give you full relief immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I earn less than £10,000?",
      answer: "You can still contribute to a pension and get tax relief on up to £3,600 gross per year, even if you don't pay tax. That means contributing £2,880 and the government adds £720."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I exceed the annual allowance?",
      answer: "You'll face an Annual Allowance Charge. This effectively claws back the tax relief you shouldn't have received. The charge is at your marginal tax rate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my employer contribute without limit?",
      answer: "Employer contributions count towards your annual allowance. However, they're unlimited from the employer's perspective (no personal earnings limit) and receive corporation tax relief."
    },
    {
      question: "Is pension tax relief worth it?",
      answer: "Almost always yes. At basic rate, you get a 25% boost immediately. At higher rate, it's an effective 67% boost. Very few investments offer guaranteed returns like this."
