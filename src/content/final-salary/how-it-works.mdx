## Worked Examples

<Callout type="example" title="Example 1: Final Salary Scheme">
**Sarah:** Private sector final salary scheme

- **Final salary:** £65,000
- **Years of service:** 25 years
- **Accrual rate:** 1/60th

**Pension calculation:**
£65,000 × 25 × 1/60 = **£27,083/year**

Plus 3x lump sum (if 1/80th scheme):
£65,000 × 25 × 3/80 = **£60,938 tax-free lump sum**
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 2: Career Average Scheme">
**Tom:** NHS Pension (2015 scheme)

- **Career average salary:** £45,000 (revalued)
- **Years of service:** 20 years
- **Accrual rate:** 1/54th

**Pension calculation:**
£45,000 × 20 × 1/54 = **£16,667/year**

Tom can also take 25% as tax-free lump sum by commuting some pension.

## Career Average vs Final Salary

<DataTable
  title="CARE vs Final Salary"
  columns={[
    { key: "aspect", header: "Aspect" },
    { key: "final", header: "Final Salary" },
    { key: "care", header: "Career Average (CARE)", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { aspect: "Salary used", final: "Salary at retirement/leaving", care: "Average of all years (revalued)" },
    { aspect: "Who benefits most", final: "High earners at end of career", care: "Those with steady earnings" },
    { aspect: "Revaluation", final: "N/A", care: "Past salaries increased by CPI or similar" },
    { aspect: "Risk if salary drops", final: "Lower pension", care: "Less impact" }
  ]}
/>

## Revaluation in Career Average Schemes

<Callout type="info" title="How Revaluation Works">
In CARE schemes, each year's pension entitlement is revalued (usually by CPI + a margin) until retirement.

**Example:**
- 2015: Earn £30,000, pension for year = £30,000 × 1/54 = £556
- By 2045 (retirement), that £556 might be worth £1,200+ after 30 years of revaluation

## Tax-Free Lump Sum Options

<DataTable
  title="Lump Sum Options"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme Type" },
    { key: "automatic", header: "Automatic Lump Sum?", highlight: true },
    { key: "commutation", header: "Can Commute Pension?" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scheme: "1/80th schemes", automatic: "Yes (3x pension)", commutation: "Sometimes, for more lump sum" },
    { scheme: "1/60th schemes", automatic: "No", commutation: "Yes (reduce pension for lump sum)" },
    { scheme: "NHS (2015)", automatic: "No", commutation: "Yes (reduce pension for lump sum)" },
    { scheme: "LGPS", automatic: "No", commutation: "Yes (reduce pension for lump sum)" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Commutation Example">
**£20,000/year pension, commutation factor 12:1**

For every £1 of pension you give up, you receive £12 lump sum.

- Give up £5,000/year pension
- Receive £60,000 tax-free lump sum
- Remaining pension: £15,000/year

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What if I leave before retirement age?",
      answer: "You become a 'deferred member'. Your pension is preserved and usually increases with inflation until you claim it at scheme retirement age."
    },
    {
      question: "Can overtime count towards my pension?",
      answer: "Usually no. Most DB schemes only count basic salary. Check your scheme booklet for the exact definition of pensionable salary."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between 1/60th and 1/80th schemes?",
      answer: "1/60th schemes give higher pension but no automatic lump sum. 1/80th schemes give lower pension but include an automatic 3x lump sum. Overall value is similar."
    },
    {
      question: "How does inflation protection work?",
      answer: "Most DB pensions increase annually in payment, usually by CPI (up to a cap, often 2.5% or 5%). This protects your purchasing power over retirement."
