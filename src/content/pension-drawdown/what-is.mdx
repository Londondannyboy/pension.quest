## What is Drawdown?

**Pension drawdown** is a way to take money from your pension pot while keeping the rest invested. Instead of buying a fixed income for life (an annuity), you manage your pot yourself.

Think of it like this: your pension pot becomes a bank account that's still invested. You can take out money when you need it, while the remaining money continues to grow (or fall) with the markets.

## Simple Example

<Callout type="example" title="How It Works in Practice">
**Sarah** has a £200,000 pension pot:

1. She moves it into drawdown
2. She takes £50,000 tax-free (25%)
3. She leaves £150,000 invested
4. She takes £6,000/year as income (4%)
5. Her pot continues to grow/shrink with investments

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is drawdown the same as cashing in my pension?",
      answer: "No. Cashing in means taking everything out. Drawdown means keeping your pot invested while taking regular income from it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can anyone use drawdown?",
      answer: "You need to be 55+ (57 from 2028) and have a defined contribution pension. Defined benefit (final salary) pensions work differently."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I run out of money?",
      answer: "Unlike an annuity, drawdown can run out if you withdraw too much or investments perform poorly. This is the main risk."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my mind?",
      answer: "You can stop taking income or buy an annuity with your remaining pot. But you can't 'undo' withdrawals already made."
    }
