**Can you retire at 55?** Technically yes, if you have enough saved. Here's exactly what you need.

## The Challenge: The State Pension Gap

<DataTable
  title="The Gap You Need to Bridge"
  columns={[
    { key: "age", header: "Your Age" },
    { key: "income", header: "Income Sources", highlight: true },
    { key: "years", header: "Years Until SPA" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { age: "55-57", income: "Private pensions only", years: "11-12 years" },
    { age: "57-60", income: "Private pensions only", years: "6-10 years" },
    { age: "60-66", income: "Private pensions only", years: "0-6 years" },
    { age: "66-67", income: "Private pension + State Pension", years: "Reached SPA" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Important: 2028 Change">
From April 2028, the minimum private pension access age rises to **57**. If you're planning to retire at 55, you must be 55 and access your pension before this date.

## How Much Do You Need?

<DataTable

  columns={[
    { key: "level", header: "Lifestyle" },
    { key: "annual", header: "Annual Need", highlight: true },
    { key: "for12years", header: "55-67 Total" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { level: "Minimum", annual: "£14,400", for12years: "£172,800" },
    { level: "Moderate", annual: "£31,300", for12years: "£375,600" },
    { level: "Comfortable", annual: "£43,100", for12years: "£517,200" }

<Callout type="example" title="Example: Retiring at 55 on Moderate Income">
**Sarah wants to retire at 55 with a moderate lifestyle (£31,300/year)**

**Years to bridge:** 12 years (55 to 67)
**Total needed:** 12 × £31,300 = **£375,600**

**Plus buffer for:**
- Inflation (costs rise ~3% annually)
- Healthcare costs
- Emergencies
- Market volatility

**Realistic target: £450,000 - £500,000 in private pensions**

After 67, State Pension covers ~£11,500/year, reducing private pension draw.

## The 4% Rule Approach

<DataTable
  title="Sustainable Withdrawal Calculator"
  columns={[
    { key: "pot", header: "Pension Pot" },
    { key: "annual", header: "4% Annual Withdrawal", highlight: true },
    { key: "monthly", header: "Monthly Income" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { pot: "£200,000", annual: "£8,000", monthly: "£667" },
    { pot: "£300,000", annual: "£12,000", monthly: "£1,000" },
    { pot: "£400,000", annual: "£16,000", monthly: "£1,333" },
    { pot: "£500,000", annual: "£20,000", monthly: "£1,667" },
    { pot: "£600,000", annual: "£24,000", monthly: "£2,000" },
    { pot: "£750,000", annual: "£30,000", monthly: "£2,500" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="The 4% Rule">
The 4% rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your pot in year one, then adjusting for inflation each year. This historically provided a 30-year income without running out. However, retiring at 55 means potentially 40+ years of retirement.

## Making It Work: Strategies

### 1. Phased Retirement

<DataTable
  title="Phased Retirement Example"
  columns={[
    { key: "age", header: "Age" },

    { age: "55-60", work: "Part-time (3 days/week)", income: "£15k salary + £10k pension" },
    { age: "60-66", work: "Occasional work", income: "£5k salary + £20k pension" },
    { age: "66+", work: "Fully retired", income: "State Pension + private pension" }
  ]}

### 3. Use Your Tax-Free Lump Sum

<Callout type="tip" title="25% Tax-Free">
Take up to 25% of your pension tax-free. On a £400,000 pot, that's £100,000 tax-free that could cover several years of early retirement.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I access State Pension at 55?",
      answer: "No. State Pension can only be claimed from State Pension age (currently 66, rising to 67). You cannot access it early under any circumstances."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I run out of money before State Pension?",
      answer: "You'd need to return to work or rely on means-tested benefits like Pension Credit. This is why careful planning and buffer funds are essential."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I work part-time and draw pension at 55?",
      answer: "Yes! This 'phased retirement' is common. You can work as much or little as you want while drawing private pension. No rules against it."
    },
    {
      question: "Is £300,000 enough to retire at 55?",
      answer: "At 4% withdrawal, £300k provides £12,000/year. With State Pension from 67, possibly enough for minimum lifestyle. Moderate lifestyle typically needs £400k+."
