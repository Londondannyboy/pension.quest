## How Final Salary Pensions Work

<DataTable
  title="DB Pension Calculation"
  columns={[
    { key: "factor", header: "Factor" },
    { key: "meaning", header: "What It Means", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { factor: "Final salary", meaning: "Your salary when you leave/retire (or average salary)" },
    { factor: "Years of service", meaning: "How long you've been in the scheme" },
    { factor: "Accrual rate", meaning: "Fraction of salary earned per year (e.g., 1/60th)" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Classic DB Calculation">
**Final salary:** £50,000
**Years of service:** 30 years
**Accrual rate:** 1/60th

**Annual pension:** £50,000 × 30 × 1/60 = **£25,000/year for life**

Plus:
- Usually increases with inflation
- Spouse receives 50% if you die
- Tax-free lump sum option

## Value of DB Pensions

<Callout type="info" title="Transfer Value">
DB pensions are extremely valuable. A DB pension worth £20,000/year might have a transfer value of £400,000-600,000 or more. This is the amount you'd need in a DC pension to replicate the guaranteed income.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Are final salary pensions still available?",
      answer: "Most private sector schemes are closed to new members. Public sector schemes (NHS, Teachers, LGPS, Civil Service) remain open but now use career average rather than final salary calculations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my DB pension to a SIPP?",
      answer: "Yes, but you must take regulated financial advice if the transfer value exceeds £30,000. Transferring gives up valuable guarantees, so it's rarely recommended."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my DB pension if my employer goes bust?",
      answer: "The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) protects DB pensions. If your scheme enters the PPF, you'll typically receive 90-100% of your pension depending on your age at the time."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take my DB pension early?",
      answer: "Most schemes allow early retirement from a certain age (often 55-60) with a reduced pension. The reduction is typically 3-6% per year before normal pension age."
    },
    {
      question: "How much is my DB pension worth?",
      answer: "Request a transfer value from your scheme. A rough guide: multiply your annual pension by 20-30. So £20,000/year might be worth £400,000-600,000 as a transfer value."
