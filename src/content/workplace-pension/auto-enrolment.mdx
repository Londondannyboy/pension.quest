**Auto-enrolment** is the UK's system for automatically putting eligible workers into a workplace pension. Since 2012, millions more people are now saving for retirement.

## What is Auto-Enrolment?

Auto-enrolment means your employer must:
1. **Assess** whether you're eligible
2. **Enrol** you into a qualifying pension scheme
3. **Contribute** at least 3% of your qualifying earnings

<Callout type="info" title="It's Automatic">
You don't need to do anything to be enrolled. If you're eligible, your employer must set everything up for you.

### Qualifying Earnings Band

Contributions are calculated on earnings between:
- **Lower limit**: £6,240 per year
- **Upper limit**: £50,270 per year

<Callout type="example" title="Contribution Calculation">
**Sarah** earns £28,000 per year:

- Qualifying earnings: £28,000 - £6,240 = **£21,760**
- Her contribution (5%): £21,760 × 5% = **£1,088/year** (£91/month)
- Employer contribution (3%): £21,760 × 3% = **£653/year** (£54/month)
- **Total annual contribution**: £1,741
</Callout>

## How to Opt Out

If you decide auto-enrolment isn't for you:

### The Process

1. **Get the opt-out form** from your pension provider (details in your enrolment letter)
2. **Complete and submit** within one month of enrolment
3. **Get refund** of any contributions already taken

<DataTable
  title="Opt-Out Timeline"
  columns={[
    { key: "timeframe", header: "When You Opt Out" },
    { key: "result", header: "What Happens", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { timeframe: "Within 1 month", result: "Full refund of all contributions" },
    { timeframe: "After 1 month", result: "No refund - money stays in pension" },
    { timeframe: "After 2 years", result: "Can transfer to another pension" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Think Carefully">
By opting out, you lose:
- **Free employer contributions** (3%+ of qualifying earnings)
- **Tax relief** (government top-up on your contributions)
- **Years of investment growth**

For most people, staying in is the better choice.
</Callout>

## Re-Enrolment

If you've opted out, your employer must:

- **Re-assess** you every 3 years
- **Re-enrol** you if still eligible
- **Notify** you when this happens

You can opt out again each time, but the process resets.

## Your Rights

### Employers Must:

- Enrol eligible workers automatically
- Contribute at least 3%
- Not encourage opting out
- Not treat you differently for being in the pension
- Keep paying into your pension while employed

### Employers Cannot:

- Fire you for joining the pension
- Reduce your pay because of pension contributions
- Pressure you to opt out
- Use misleading information about the scheme

<Callout type="info" title="Protection">
If your employer pressures you to opt out or treats you unfairly because of pension membership, you can complain to The Pensions Regulator.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "When will I be auto-enrolled?",
      answer: "You'll be enrolled from your first payday after becoming eligible (aged 22+, earning over £10,000, working in the UK). Your employer must enrol you within 6 weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my employer opt me out?",
      answer: "No. Only you can decide to opt out. Your employer cannot opt you out or encourage you to leave the scheme."
    },
    {
      question: "I'm a contractor - am I eligible?",
      answer: "It depends on your employment status. If you're genuinely self-employed, auto-enrolment doesn't apply. If you're an employee (even on a zero-hours contract), you may be eligible if you meet the age and earnings criteria."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I already have a pension with my employer?",
      answer: "If you're already in a qualifying pension scheme with sufficient contributions, your employer doesn't need to auto-enrol you into another one."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I choose where my pension is invested?",
      answer: "Most schemes offer a default investment fund plus options to choose different funds. Check with your pension provider what options are available."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I earn from multiple jobs?",
      answer: "Each employer assesses you separately. You might be auto-enrolled by one employer but not another, depending on your earnings with each."
    }
