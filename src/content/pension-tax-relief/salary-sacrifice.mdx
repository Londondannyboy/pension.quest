**Salary sacrifice** is the most tax-efficient way to contribute to your pension.

## How Salary Sacrifice Works

<Callout type="info" title="The Basic Concept">
Instead of receiving salary and then contributing to your pension, you **agree to receive less salary** in exchange for your employer making a larger pension contribution.

Because you never receive the money as salary, you don't pay income tax OR National Insurance on it.

## The Numbers: Why It's Better

<Callout type="example" title="£100 Pension Contribution Comparison">
**Basic Rate Taxpayer (20% tax, 12% NI)**

**Standard contribution:**
- You earn £100 gross
- Minus 20% tax = £80
- Minus 12% NI = £68 take-home
- You contribute £68 → pension gets £85 (after relief at source)

**Salary sacrifice:**
- £100 goes directly to pension
- You pay no tax, no NI
- Pension gets £100
- **Extra £15 in your pension**

*Plus your employer saves 13.8% NI (£13.80) which they should add to your pension!*

<Callout type="tip" title="Ask About NI Savings">
Good employers pass some or all of their NI savings to your pension. Ask your HR department:
- Does our scheme use salary sacrifice?
- Do you pass on employer NI savings?
- How much extra do I get?

<Callout type="warning" title="Check Before Sacrificing">
If your salary after sacrifice falls below ~£12,570, or you're planning a mortgage or parental leave, consider the impacts carefully. You can usually adjust your sacrifice level if circumstances change.
</Callout>

## National Minimum Wage Protection

<Callout type="info" title="Salary Can't Fall Below NMW">
You cannot use salary sacrifice to reduce your pay below the National Minimum Wage. If your hourly rate after sacrifice would be below NMW, you cannot sacrifice that much.

This mainly affects lower-paid workers or those sacrificing very large amounts.

## Worked Example: Full Year

<Callout type="example" title="Higher Rate Taxpayer Example">
**Sarah earns £70,000 and wants £6,000 in her pension:**

**Without salary sacrifice:**
- Gross salary: £70,000
- Pension contribution: £6,000 (net pay)
- Tax saving: £2,400 (40%)
- **Cost to Sarah: £3,600**

**With salary sacrifice:**
- Gross salary: £64,000 (after £6,000 sacrifice)
- Employer contributes £6,000 to pension
- Tax saving: £2,400 (40%)
- NI saving: £120 (2% × £6,000)
- **Cost to Sarah: £3,480**
- **Extra £120/year in her pocket**

*Plus employer may add their £828 NI saving (13.8% × £6,000) = £6,828 in pension!*

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is salary sacrifice the same as pension contributions?",
      answer: "No. With salary sacrifice, your employer makes the contribution (from the salary you've given up). With standard contributions, you make them from your post-tax or pre-tax income."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I opt out of salary sacrifice?",
      answer: "Usually yes, but there may be limited windows (e.g., annually) when you can change. Some schemes allow changes with life events (marriage, children)."
    },
    {
      question: "Does salary sacrifice count towards my annual allowance?",
      answer: "Yes. The employer contribution made via salary sacrifice counts as an employer contribution towards your £60,000 annual allowance."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my employer doesn't offer salary sacrifice?",
      answer: "Ask them to consider it! It saves them money (NI) too. Otherwise, use the regular contribution method - you still get income tax relief."
