**Pension drawdown** lets you take flexible income from your pension while keeping your money invested. It's the most popular way to access defined contribution pensions.

## What is Pension Drawdown?

Drawdown (also called flexi-access drawdown) is a way to take income from your pension pot while leaving it invested. Unlike an annuity, you don't convert your pot to a guaranteed income - you manage it yourself.

## How Drawdown Works

### Step 1: Move Into Drawdown

When you access your pension:
1. Transfer your pot (or part of it) into a drawdown account
2. Take up to 25% as tax-free cash if desired
3. The rest stays invested

### Step 2: Take Income

### Step 3: Manage Investments

Your remaining pot stays invested. You can:
- Choose investment funds
- Adjust risk level over time
- Switch between funds
- Monitor performance

## Sustainable Withdrawal Rates

How much can you safely withdraw without running out?

<DataTable
  title="Withdrawal Rate Guidelines"
  columns={[
    { key: "rate", header: "Annual Rate" },
    { key: "pot_lasts", header: "Pot May Last", highlight: true },
    { key: "risk", header: "Risk Level" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rate: "3%", pot_lasts: "40+ years", risk: "Low - very conservative" },
    { rate: "4%", pot_lasts: "~30 years", risk: "Moderate - the '4% rule'" },
    { rate: "5%", pot_lasts: "~24 years", risk: "Higher - may deplete" },
    { rate: "6%", pot_lasts: "~19 years", risk: "High - likely to deplete" },
    { rate: "7%+", pot_lasts: "~15 years or less", risk: "Very high" }
  ]}

<Callout type="example" title="The 4% Rule">
**The 4% Rule** suggests you can withdraw 4% of your pot in year one, then adjust for inflation each year, with a good chance of lasting 30 years.

**£300,000 pot:**
- Year 1: £300,000 × 4% = £12,000
- Year 2: £12,000 × 1.02 = £12,240
- Year 3: £12,240 × 1.02 = £12,485

This is a guideline, not a guarantee. Review regularly.

## Tax on Drawdown Withdrawals

<DataTable
  title="How Withdrawals Are Taxed"
  columns={[
    { key: "portion", header: "Portion" },
    { key: "tax", header: "Tax Treatment", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { portion: "25% tax-free cash", tax: "No tax" },
    { portion: "Remaining 75%", tax: "Taxed as income" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Watch Your Tax Band">
Drawdown withdrawals are added to your other income. Large withdrawals could push you into a higher tax band. Spreading withdrawals across tax years can be more efficient.
</Callout>

## Sequence of Returns Risk

<Callout type="warning" title="Early Losses Hurt Most">
If markets fall early in your drawdown while you're withdrawing, your pot takes a double hit. This is "sequence of returns risk" - the order of returns matters as much as the average.
</Callout>

### Managing Sequence Risk

- Keep 1-3 years of income in cash/bonds
- Reduce withdrawals in down markets if possible
- Consider a "bucket strategy"
- Don't start drawdown at a market peak if avoidable

## Drawdown Strategies

### The Bucket Strategy

Divide your pot into "buckets":

<DataTable
  title="Bucket Strategy Example"
  columns={[
    { key: "bucket", header: "Bucket" },
    { key: "horizon", header: "Time Horizon" },
    { key: "invested", header: "Invested In", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { bucket: "1 - Cash", horizon: "0-2 years", invested: "Cash, money market" },
    { bucket: "2 - Cautious", horizon: "3-5 years", invested: "Bonds, low-risk funds" },
    { bucket: "3 - Growth", horizon: "6+ years", invested: "Equities, growth funds" }
  ]}
/>

### Phased Drawdown

Instead of moving all your pot at once:
- Crystallise in stages over several years
- Spread your 25% tax-free entitlement
- Keep some pot growing without drawdown charges

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What is the difference between drawdown and taking a lump sum?",
      answer: "Drawdown keeps your pot invested while you take income. A lump sum (UFPLS) takes money out completely. With UFPLS, 25% of each withdrawal is tax-free; with drawdown, you can take 25% of your whole pot tax-free upfront."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch from drawdown to an annuity?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use your remaining drawdown pot to buy an annuity at any time. Many people use drawdown early in retirement, then buy an annuity later for security."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to drawdown when I die?",
      answer: "Your remaining pot passes to your beneficiaries. If you die before 75, they usually receive it tax-free. After 75, they pay income tax on withdrawals."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum pot size for drawdown?",
      answer: "No legal minimum, but drawdown involves charges and complexity. For very small pots (under £10,000), cashing out might be simpler."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I put money back into drawdown?",
      answer: "You can continue contributing to other pensions, but once money is in drawdown, you can't 'top it up'. New contributions would go to a separate pension pot."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I review my drawdown?",
      answer: "At least annually. Check your pot value, withdrawal rate, investment performance, and whether your strategy still suits your needs."
    }
