## Cost Comparison Example

<Callout type="example" title="Consolidation Savings">
**Sarah has 4 pension pots totalling £100,000**

**Before consolidation:**
- Provider A: £25,000 @ 1.2% = £300/year
- Provider B: £30,000 @ 1.0% = £300/year
- Provider C: £20,000 @ 1.5% = £300/year
- Provider D: £25,000 @ 0.8% = £200/year
- **Total charges: £1,100/year**

**After consolidation (single provider @ 0.5%):**
- £100,000 @ 0.5% = **£500/year**
- **Annual saving: £600**
- Over 20 years: potentially **£12,000+** saved

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Will consolidating affect my tax?",
      answer: "No. Pension-to-pension transfers are tax-free. You only pay tax when you withdraw from your pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I consolidate DB and DC pensions together?",
      answer: "Technically yes (by transferring DB to DC), but this is rarely advisable. DB pensions provide valuable guarantees that you'd lose. Required advice for DB transfers over £30,000."
    },
    {
      question: "What if one pension has better funds than another?",
      answer: "Consider which provider gives you the best combination of low charges and good investment options. You don't have to consolidate to the largest pot."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find all my old pensions?",
      answer: "Use the government's Pension Tracing Service (free), check old payslips and bank statements, contact previous employers' HR departments."
