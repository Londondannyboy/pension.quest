**Defined benefit (final salary) pensions** have specific inheritance rules that differ from DC pensions.

## Key Difference: You Can't Choose

<Callout type="warning" title="No Nomination Form">
Unlike DC pensions, you cannot nominate beneficiaries for DB pensions. Benefits are paid to defined categories of dependants:
- Spouse/civil partner
- Children
- Sometimes cohabiting partners

You can't leave your DB pension to a friend, sibling, or charity.

## Death Before Retirement

<DataTable

  columns={[
    { key: "benefit", header: "Benefit" },
    { key: "typical", header: "Typical Amount", highlight: true },
    { key: "who", header: "Who Receives" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { benefit: "Death-in-service lump sum", typical: "2-4x salary", who: "Nominated beneficiary/dependants" },
    { benefit: "Spouse pension", typical: "50% of projected pension", who: "Spouse/civil partner" },
    { benefit: "Children's pension", typical: "Varies", who: "Dependent children" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Example: Death Before Retirement">
**Tom, 58, dies while still working.** Salary: £50,000. Projected pension: £20,000/year.

**His family receives:**
- **Lump sum:** 3x salary = £150,000 (tax-free)
- **Spouse pension:** 50% × £20,000 = £10,000/year for wife's life
- **Children:** If under 23 and in education, additional pension until they finish
</Callout>

### The Guaranteed Period

<Callout type="info" title="5-Year Guarantee">
Many DB pensions have a **5-year guaranteed period**. If you die within 5 years of retirement, your scheme may pay out the balance of 5 years' pension as a lump sum, in addition to the spouse pension.

Example: Retire at 65, die at 66. Pension was £20,000/year.
- Spouse gets: 4 years × £20,000 = £80,000 lump sum
- Plus: 50% × £20,000 = £10,000/year spouse pension for life

## Pre-1997 Service: A Warning

<Callout type="warning" title="Check Your Scheme Booklet">
Many DB schemes only provide spouse benefits for service **after certain dates**:
- Some: Post-April 1997
- Some: Post-April 1988

If you have long service before these dates, your spouse may receive significantly less than 50% of your total pension.

**Example:** 30 years' service, but 20 years pre-1997. Spouse may only get 50% of the pension built up from 10 years' service.

  ]}

<Callout type="tip" title="Protect Your Partner">
If your DB scheme doesn't cover cohabiting partners, consider:
- Life insurance to replace the spouse pension they won't receive
- Getting married or entering a civil partnership
- Checking if your scheme allows voluntary contributions to DC that you can nominate
</Callout>

## Can You Transfer to Protect Inheritance?

<Callout type="warning" title="Get Advice">
Transferring DB to DC purely for inheritance flexibility is rarely recommended. You lose valuable guarantees. Always get regulated financial advice before transferring DB pensions.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I nominate someone other than my spouse?",
      answer: "For the pension itself, no - spouse/dependant benefits are fixed by scheme rules. For any lump sum death benefit, you can often nominate anyone."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I never married?",
      answer: "Check if your scheme covers cohabiting partners. If not, there may be no pension payable after your death (except any guaranteed period lump sum or children's pensions)."
    },
    {
      question: "Does my spouse's pension increase with inflation?",
      answer: "Usually yes, but often at a lower rate than your pension increased. Check your scheme rules - it might increase by CPI, RPI, or a fixed percentage."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my spouse remarries?",
      answer: "Older schemes may stop spouse pension on remarriage. Modern schemes (post-1997) usually continue paying regardless of remarriage."
