## NEST Charges

<DataTable
  title="NEST Fee Structure"
  columns={[
    { key: "charge", header: "Charge Type" },
    { key: "rate", header: "Rate", highlight: true },
    { key: "explanation", header: "What It Means" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { charge: "Annual management charge", rate: "0.3%", explanation: "Charged on your pot value each year" },
    { charge: "Contribution charge", rate: "1.8%", explanation: "Taken from each contribution" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Charges in Practice">
**You contribute £100:**
- Contribution charge: £100 × 1.8% = £1.80
- Added to pot: £98.20
- Annual charge on £98.20: £0.29/year

Over time, as your pot grows, the 0.3% annual charge becomes the larger factor.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How do I check my NEST pension balance?",
      answer: "Log in to your NEST account at nestpensions.org.uk. You'll see your current pot value, contributions history, and projected retirement amount."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my NEST pension?",
      answer: "Yes. You can transfer your NEST pot to another pension provider, or transfer other pensions into NEST. There are no exit fees, but check the receiving scheme's charges."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if NEST fails?",
      answer: "NEST is a public body backed by the government. Your pension is held in a trust separate from NEST's operations. If anything happened, your money would still be protected."
    },
    {
      question: "Is NEST a good pension?",
      answer: "NEST is a solid, low-cost option that's suitable for most auto-enrolled workers. The 1.8% contribution charge is higher than some, but the 0.3% annual charge is competitive. For most people, it's perfectly adequate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pay extra into NEST?",
      answer: "Your employer sets up the contributions, but you can ask them to increase your percentage. You cannot make direct personal contributions to NEST like you could with a SIPP."
