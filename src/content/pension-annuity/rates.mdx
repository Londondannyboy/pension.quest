## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Why do rates vary between providers?",
      answer: "Providers have different views on life expectancy, different investment strategies, and different profit margins. This creates significant rate differences."
    },
    {
      question: "Will rates keep improving?",
      answer: "Rates follow interest rates. If interest rates stay high or rise, annuity rates should remain good. If rates fall, annuities may become less attractive."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do rates change?",
      answer: "Rates can change daily. Significant moves in bond markets or interest rate announcements can cause quick changes. Get quotes close to when you plan to buy."
