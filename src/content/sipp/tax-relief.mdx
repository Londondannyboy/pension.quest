**SIPP tax relief** is one of the biggest advantages of pension saving. Here's how it works.

## How Tax Relief Works

When you contribute to a SIPP, the government effectively refunds the tax you paid on that money:

<DataTable
  title="Tax Relief by Tax Band"
  columns={[
    { key: "band", header: "Tax Band" },
    { key: "rate", header: "Tax Rate" },
    { key: "pay", header: "You Pay" },
    { key: "insipp", header: "In SIPP", highlight: true },
    { key: "effective", header: "Effective Boost" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { band: "Basic", rate: "20%", pay: "£800", insipp: "£1,000", effective: "+25%" },
    { band: "Higher", rate: "40%", pay: "£600", insipp: "£1,000", effective: "+67%" },
    { band: "Additional", rate: "45%", pay: "£550", insipp: "£1,000", effective: "+82%" }
  ]}
/>

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Automatic Relief (Everyone)

When you contribute, your SIPP provider automatically claims 20% from HMRC:
- You pay: £800
- Provider claims: £200
- In your SIPP: £1,000

### Step 2: Extra Relief (Higher Earners)

If you pay higher or additional rate tax, you claim extra via self-assessment:

<DataTable

  columns={[
    { key: "band", header: "Tax Band" },
    { key: "auto", header: "Automatic Relief" },
    { key: "claim", header: "Extra to Claim", highlight: true },
    { key: "how", header: "How" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { band: "Basic (20%)", auto: "20%", claim: "None", how: "N/A" },
    { band: "Higher (40%)", auto: "20%", claim: "20%", how: "Self-assessment" },
    { band: "Additional (45%)", auto: "20%", claim: "25%", how: "Self-assessment" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Higher-Rate Taxpayer Example">
**Sarah** earns £70,000 and contributes £8,000 to her SIPP:

**Automatic:**
- She pays: £8,000
- Provider claims 20%: £2,000
- In SIPP: £10,000

**Via self-assessment:**
- Claims extra 20% on £10,000: £2,000 tax refund
- **Net cost to Sarah**: £6,000
- **In her SIPP**: £10,000
- **Effective boost**: 67%

## Carry Forward

If you haven't used your full allowance in previous years, you can carry it forward:

    { key: "allowance", header: "Allowance" },

  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "2021/22", allowance: "£40,000", used: "£10,000", unused: "£30,000" },
    { year: "2022/23", allowance: "£40,000", used: "£15,000", unused: "£25,000" },
    { year: "2023/24", allowance: "£60,000", used: "£20,000", unused: "£40,000" },
    { year: "2024/25", allowance: "£60,000", used: "-", unused: "-" },
    { year: "Total available 2024/25", allowance: "-", used: "-", unused: "£155,000" }

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do I get tax relief automatically?",

    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't pay tax?",
      answer: "You can still contribute up to £3,600 gross (£2,880 net) and receive 20% tax relief added automatically - even with no income."
    },
    {
      question: "Is SIPP tax relief the same as other pensions?",
      answer: "Yes, tax relief rules are identical for SIPPs, personal pensions, and workplace pensions. The Annual Allowance is shared across all."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I contribute more than the Annual Allowance?",
      answer: "Yes, but contributions above the allowance don't receive tax relief and you'll pay an Annual Allowance charge to claw back the excess relief."
