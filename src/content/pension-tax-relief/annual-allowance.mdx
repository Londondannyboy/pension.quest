## What Happens If You Exceed It?

<Callout type="warning" title="Annual Allowance Charge">
If total contributions exceed your annual allowance, you face an **Annual Allowance Charge**. This is taxed at your marginal rate, effectively clawing back the tax relief you shouldn't have received.

Example: £10,000 over allowance as 40% taxpayer = £4,000 charge.
</Callout>

  title="Exceeding the Allowance"
  columns={[
    { key: "excess", header: "Amount Over" },
    { key: "charge20", header: "Charge (20% taxpayer)", highlight: true },
    { key: "charge40", header: "Charge (40% taxpayer)" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { excess: "£5,000", charge20: "£1,000", charge40: "£2,000" },
    { excess: "£10,000", charge20: "£2,000", charge40: "£4,000" },
    { excess: "£20,000", charge20: "£4,000", charge40: "£8,000" }
  ]}
/>

## Earnings Limit

<Callout type="info" title="100% of UK Earnings">
You can only get tax relief on contributions up to **100% of your UK earnings** (or £3,600 gross if higher).

Example: Earn £40,000 → max contribution with relief is £40,000 (not £60,000 annual allowance).

Employer contributions don't have this limit.
</Callout>

## Tapered Annual Allowance

<DataTable
  title="High Earner Taper"
  columns={[
    { key: "income", header: "Adjusted Income" },
    { key: "aa", header: "Annual Allowance", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { income: "Up to £260,000", aa: "£60,000" },
    { income: "£260,001 - £360,000", aa: "Tapered (£60k to £10k)" },
    { income: "Over £360,000", aa: "£10,000 minimum" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Taper Calculation">
For every £2 of 'adjusted income' over £260,000, your annual allowance reduces by £1. Minimum allowance: £10,000.

'Adjusted income' includes all income plus employer pension contributions.
</Callout>

## Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA)

<DataTable
  title="MPAA Triggers"
  columns={[
    { key: "trigger", header: "MPAA Is Triggered If You" },
    { key: "counts", header: "Triggers MPAA?", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { trigger: "Take income via flexi-access drawdown", counts: "Yes" },
    { trigger: "Take an UFPLS (uncrystallised funds pension lump sum)", counts: "Yes" },
    { trigger: "Cash in entire small pot", counts: "Yes (if over £10k)" },
    { trigger: "Take 25% tax-free cash only", counts: "No" },
    { trigger: "Buy an annuity", counts: "No" },
    { trigger: "Take capped drawdown (pre-2015)", counts: "No" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="MPAA Effect">
Once triggered, your annual allowance for DC contributions drops from **£60,000 to £10,000**. This is permanent. You cannot use carry forward for the MPAA portion.
</Callout>

## Calculating DB Pension Input

<Callout type="info" title="DB Pensions: Pension Input Amount">
For defined benefit pensions, contributions don't work the same way. Instead, the 'pension input amount' is calculated as:

**Increase in annual pension × 16**

Example: Pension increased by £3,000 this year
Input amount: £3,000 × 16 = **£48,000**

This leaves £12,000 of standard annual allowance for DC contributions.
</Callout>

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What if I don't use my full allowance?",
      answer: "Unused allowance can be carried forward for 3 years (see our carry forward guide). You can use it to make larger contributions in future years."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to report exceeding the allowance?",
      answer: "Yes, via self-assessment tax return. If the charge exceeds £2,000, you can ask your pension scheme to pay it from your pension ('Scheme Pays')."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the annual allowance apply to all my pensions combined?",
      answer: "Yes. It's a total across all your pensions - workplace, personal, SIPPs, everything. You can't use £60,000 in each."
    },
    {
      question: "What about employer contributions - do they count?",
      answer: "Yes. Both your and employer contributions count towards the £60,000 annual allowance. Large employer contributions can use up your allowance quickly."
