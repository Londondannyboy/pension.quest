## Fee Comparison

<Callout type="example" title="Fee Comparison Example">
**£50,000 pot, index fund investing:**

**SIPP (e.g., Vanguard):**
- Platform fee: 0.15% = £75
- Fund fee: 0.10% = £50
- **Total: £125/year**

**Personal Pension (e.g., Standard Life):**
- All-in charge: 0.50% = £250
- **Total: £250/year**

SIPP saves £125/year in this example. But it requires more decisions.
