Your **pension nomination form** determines who inherits your pension when you die.

## Why Nomination Matters

<Callout type="warning" title="Pensions Don't Follow Your Will">
Unlike most assets, your pension is held in a trust. It passes based on your **nomination form**, not your will. Without a nomination, trustees decide who gets it - and it may not be who you'd choose.
</Callout>

<DataTable
  title="Will vs Nomination Form"
  columns={[
    { key: "aspect", header: "Aspect" },
    { key: "will", header: "Will" },
    { key: "nomination", header: "Nomination Form", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { aspect: "Controls pension?", will: "No", nomination: "Yes" },
    { aspect: "Legal status", will: "Legally binding", nomination: "Expression of wish" },

    { aspect: "Can be challenged?", will: "Yes, through courts", nomination: "Rarely" }

## How to Complete Your Nomination

### Step 1: Get the Form

<DataTable
  title="Where to Find Your Nomination Form"
  columns={[
    { key: "provider", header: "Pension Type" },
    { key: "where", header: "Where to Find", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { provider: "Workplace pension", where: "HR department or pension provider website" },
    { provider: "SIPP", where: "Provider's online account or app" },
    { provider: "Personal pension", where: "Provider website or call them" },
    { provider: "Old workplace pension", where: "Contact scheme administrator" }
  ]}
/>

### Step 2: Choose Your Beneficiaries

You can nominate:
- **Individuals** - spouse, children, siblings, friends
- **Multiple people** - with percentage splits
- **Charities** - registered charity number needed
- **Trusts** - for complex situations

<DataTable
  title="Common Nomination Setups"
  columns={[
    { key: "situation", header: "Your Situation" },
    { key: "nomination", header: "Typical Nomination", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { situation: "Married with children", nomination: "100% to spouse, or split spouse/children" },
    { situation: "Unmarried with partner", nomination: "100% to partner (critical for cohabiting couples)" },
    { situation: "Single with siblings", nomination: "Split between siblings" },
    { situation: "No close family", nomination: "Friends, godchildren, or charity" },
    { situation: "Complex family", nomination: "Consider percentages or contingent nominations" }
  ]}
/>

### Step 3: Specify Percentages

<Callout type="example" title="Example Nominations">
**Simple:** 100% to Jane Smith (spouse)

**Split:**
- 50% to Jane Smith (spouse)
- 25% to Tom Smith (son)
- 25% to Emma Smith (daughter)

**Contingent:**
- Primary: 100% to Jane Smith (spouse)
- If Jane predeceases: 50% each to Tom and Emma Smith
</Callout>

### Step 4: Provide Details

You'll typically need:

<DataTable
  title="Information Required"
  columns={[
    { key: "info", header: "Information" },
    { key: "why", header: "Why It's Needed", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { info: "Full name", why: "To identify the beneficiary" },
    { info: "Date of birth", why: "To verify identity" },
    { info: "Address", why: "To contact them" },
    { info: "Relationship to you", why: "Helps trustees make decisions" },
    { info: "National Insurance number", why: "Some schemes require this" }
  ]}
/>

## When to Update Your Nomination

<DataTable
  title="Life Events Requiring Update"
  columns={[
    { key: "event", header: "Life Event" },
    { key: "action", header: "Action Needed", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { event: "Marriage", action: "Add spouse, review percentages" },
    { event: "Divorce", action: "Remove ex-spouse" },
    { event: "New child", action: "Add child or update split" },
    { event: "Death of nominee", action: "Remove and nominate replacement" },
    { event: "New relationship", action: "Consider adding partner" },
    { event: "Every 2-3 years", action: "Review to ensure still correct" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Divorce Doesn't Automatically Remove Ex-Spouse">
If you nominated your spouse before divorce, they may still be nominated after divorce. Trustees might not pay them, but it causes delay and complication. **Always update after divorce.**
</Callout>

## "Expression of Wish" Explained

<Callout type="info" title="Not Legally Binding">
Most pension nominations are an **"expression of wish"** - you're telling trustees who you'd like to receive your pension. Trustees have discretion and usually follow your wishes, but aren't legally bound.

**Why discretion exists:** It helps avoid inheritance tax and ensures benefits reach the right people (e.g., if your nominated beneficiary predeceased you).
</Callout>

## Multiple Pensions, Multiple Forms

<DataTable
  title="Managing Multiple Nominations"
  columns={[
    { key: "pension", header: "Pension" },
    { key: "form", header: "Form Needed", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { pension: "Current workplace pension", form: "Nomination with current employer" },
    { pension: "Old workplace pension", form: "Separate nomination (may be outdated)" },
    { pension: "SIPP", form: "SIPP provider nomination" },
    { pension: "Personal pension", form: "Personal pension provider nomination" }
  ]}

<Callout type="tip" title="Track All Your Nominations">
If you have multiple pensions, each needs its own nomination. Keep a list of where you have pensions and when you last updated each nomination.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I nominate someone not in my will?",
      answer: "Yes. Pension nominations are completely separate from your will. You can nominate anyone - they don't need to be mentioned in your will."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't complete a nomination?",
      answer: "Trustees decide who inherits, usually following their rules (spouse first, then children, then other relatives). This causes delays and may not reflect your wishes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my nomination anytime?",
      answer: "Yes. You can update your nomination whenever you want, as many times as you want. The most recent nomination applies."
    },
    {
      question: "Do trustees always follow my nomination?",
      answer: "Usually yes, but they have discretion. They might not follow it if, for example, the nominee predeceased you or circumstances have clearly changed."
