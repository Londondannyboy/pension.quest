<Callout type="example" title="Early Retirement Example">
**Sarah's DB pension at NPA 65: £24,000/year**

**If she retires at 60 (5 years early):**
- Reduction: ~25% (scheme-specific)
- Pension: £24,000 × 0.75 = **£18,000/year**

**Trade-off:**
- Gets pension 5 years earlier
- Receives it for potentially longer
- But £6,000/year less throughout retirement
</Callout>

## Late Retirement

<Callout type="info" title="Late Retirement Considerations">
Working past NPA can significantly boost your pension. But consider:
- You're working instead of enjoying retirement
- Health may change
- Scheme rules vary on how late you can retire

## Commutation: Pension for Lump Sum

<DataTable
  title="Commutation Explained"
  columns={[
    { key: "aspect", header: "Aspect" },
    { key: "detail", header: "Detail", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { aspect: "What is it?", detail: "Exchanging annual pension for tax-free lump sum" },
    { aspect: "How much?", detail: "Typically £12 lump sum per £1 pension given up" },
    { aspect: "Maximum", detail: "Usually 25% of pension value (or scheme limit)" },
    { aspect: "Tax treatment", detail: "Lump sum is tax-free" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Commutation Example">
**John's pension: £30,000/year. Commutation factor: 12:1**

**Option 1: Full pension**
- £30,000/year for life
- No lump sum

**Option 2: Maximum commutation**
- Commute £7,500/year of pension
- Receive £7,500 × 12 = **£90,000 tax-free lump sum**
- Remaining pension: **£22,500/year**

**Is it worth it?**
At 12:1, the lump sum "repays" in 12 years if you live that long.

## Commutation Factors

  title="Understanding Commutation Factors"
  columns={[
    { key: "factor", header: "Commutation Factor" },
    { key: "meaning", header: "What It Means", highlight: true },
    { key: "assessment", header: "Assessment" }

    { factor: "12:1 to 15:1", meaning: "£12-15 for every £1 given up", assessment: "Neutral" },
    { factor: "Above 15:1", meaning: "More than £15 for every £1 given up", assessment: "Good value" },
    { factor: "20:1+", meaning: "£20+ for every £1 given up", assessment: "Excellent value" }
  ]}

## 1/80th Schemes: Automatic Lump Sum

<Callout type="info" title="1/80th Schemes">
Some older schemes (especially pre-2008 public sector) use **1/80th** accrual with an automatic lump sum of **3/80ths × salary × years**.

**Example:** 30 years, £40,000 salary
- Pension: 30/80 × £40,000 = £15,000/year
- Automatic lump sum: 3 × 30/80 × £40,000 = £45,000 tax-free

You may also be able to commute extra pension for additional lump sum.

## Phased/Flexible Retirement

<DataTable
  title="Phased Retirement Options"
  columns={[
    { key: "option", header: "Option" },
    { key: "how", header: "How It Works", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { option: "Take partial pension", how: "Take 25%, 50%, or 75% of pension while working" },
    { option: "Reduce hours", how: "Go part-time and take partial pension" },
    { option: "Same hours, pension top-up", how: "Keep working full-time, boost income with pension" },
    { option: "Wind down to retirement", how: "Gradually reduce work while building pension income" }
  ]}

<Callout type="warning" title="Check Scheme Rules">
Not all DB schemes offer flexible retirement. Many private schemes require you to leave employment to claim pension. Check your scheme booklet or contact the administrator.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What's the earliest I can take my DB pension?",
      answer: "Usually 55, but check your scheme rules. Some older schemes allow 50. Taking it early means significant reductions to your pension amount."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take my full DB pension as a lump sum?",
      answer: "Not usually. DB pensions are designed to provide income. You can typically commute up to 25% of value as tax-free cash. Taking more requires transferring out (rarely advisable)."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my pension if I die soon after retiring?",
      answer: "Many schemes have a 5-year guaranteed period. If you die within 5 years, remaining payments are made to your estate. Spouse pension continues regardless."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my mind after commuting?",
      answer: "No. Once you've made your retirement choices and benefits are in payment, they cannot be changed. Make sure you're happy with your decision."
