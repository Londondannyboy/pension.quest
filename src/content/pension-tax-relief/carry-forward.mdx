**Carry forward** lets you boost your pension contributions using unused allowances from previous years.

## How Carry Forward Works

<Callout type="info" title="The Basic Rule">
If you haven't used your full annual allowance in previous years, you can carry it forward and use it this year. You can use unused allowance from the **previous 3 tax years**.
</Callout>

<DataTable
  title="Carry Forward Example (2024/25)"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Tax Year" },
    { key: "allowance", header: "Annual Allowance" },
    { key: "used", header: "Contributions Made" },
    { key: "unused", header: "Unused", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "2021/22", allowance: "£40,000", used: "£20,000", unused: "£20,000" },
    { year: "2022/23", allowance: "£40,000", used: "£30,000", unused: "£10,000" },
    { year: "2023/24", allowance: "£60,000", used: "£60,000", unused: "£0" },
    { year: "2024/25", allowance: "£60,000", used: "-", unused: "-" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Continuing the Example">
**In 2024/25, you can contribute:**
- 2024/25 allowance: £60,000
- 2021/22 unused: £20,000
- 2022/23 unused: £10,000
- 2023/24 unused: £0

**Total available: £90,000**

(Assuming you earn at least £90,000 for the earnings limit)
</Callout>

## Rules and Requirements

<DataTable
  title="Carry Forward Rules"
  columns={[
    { key: "rule", header: "Rule" },
    { key: "detail", header: "Detail", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rule: "Must have been pension member", detail: "You must have been a member of a registered pension scheme in each year you want to carry forward from" },
    { rule: "Use current year first", detail: "You must use this year's £60,000 before using carry forward" },
    { rule: "Use oldest year first", detail: "After current year, use the oldest carry forward year first" },
    { rule: "Earnings limit applies", detail: "Tax relief limited to 100% of UK earnings" },
    { rule: "Lost after 3 years", detail: "Unused allowance from 4+ years ago is gone" }

## Eligibility Check

<DataTable
  title="Were You a Pension Member?"
  columns={[
    { key: "situation", header: "Situation" },
    { key: "counts", header: "Counts as Member?", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { situation: "Contributing to workplace pension", counts: "Yes" },
    { situation: "Contributing to SIPP/personal pension", counts: "Yes" },
    { situation: "Member but not contributing", counts: "Yes" },
    { situation: "Not a member of any pension", counts: "No - can't carry forward" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Open a Pension to Start the Clock">
If you're not currently a pension member, open a SIPP or personal pension now (even with minimal contributions). This starts the 3-year clock for future carry forward eligibility.
</Callout>

## Maximum Possible Contribution

<DataTable
  title="Maximum Using Carry Forward (2024/25)"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Year" },
    { key: "max", header: "Maximum Unused", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "2024/25 (current)", max: "£60,000" },
    { year: "2023/24", max: "£60,000" },
    { year: "2022/23", max: "£40,000" },
    { year: "2021/22", max: "£40,000" },
    { year: "Total potential", max: "£200,000" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Earnings Limit Still Applies">
Even with £200,000 of allowance, you can only get tax relief on contributions up to **100% of your UK earnings**.

If you earn £80,000, maximum with relief is £80,000 (not £200,000).

Employer contributions don't have this limit - they can contribute on top.
</Callout>

## Common Carry Forward Scenarios

<Callout type="example" title="Scenario 1: Bonus Year">
**Tom earns £50,000 but gets a £30,000 bonus this year (£80,000 total)**

Previous unused allowances:
- 2021/22: £30,000
- 2022/23: £20,000
- 2023/24: £40,000

He can contribute up to £80,000 (earnings limit) with full tax relief:
- £60,000 current year
- £20,000 from carry forward

He saves the remaining £70,000 carry forward for future years... except the 2021/22 amount will expire.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Scenario 2: Company Sale">
**Sarah sells her business and has £500,000 available**

She has 3 years of unused allowance (£140,000 total available).

But her UK earnings this year are only £12,570.

**Maximum contribution with tax relief: £12,570** (not £140,000)

Tax relief doesn't apply to amounts above her earnings. She could contribute more, but excess won't receive tax relief.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do I need to tell HMRC I'm using carry forward?",
      answer: "Not specifically. Just report your contributions on your self-assessment. HMRC will calculate if you exceed the current year allowance and whether carry forward covers it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use carry forward with salary sacrifice?",
      answer: "Yes. Salary sacrifice counts as employer contributions, and these can use carry forward allowance. However, you can only sacrifice salary you're due to receive."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I triggered the MPAA?",
      answer: "If you've triggered the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (£10,000), carry forward only applies to the DB portion of your allowance, not the MPAA portion."
    },
    {
      question: "Does carry forward work for DB pensions?",
      answer: "Yes. If your DB pension input amount was less than the annual allowance in previous years, that unused amount can be carried forward."
    }
