## Protected Pension Ages

Some people can still access their pension before 57:

<Callout type="info" title="Who Has Protection?">
**Protected pension age** applies if:

- Your scheme allowed access before 55 on 4 April 2006
- You joined that scheme before 6 April 2006
- You haven't transferred to a new scheme

Common examples: Some older defined benefit schemes, certain public sector schemes.

## The 2028 Change Explained

<DataTable
  title="Timeline of Changes"
  columns={[
    { key: "date", header: "Date" },
    { key: "change", header: "What Happens", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { date: "Now - 5 April 2028", change: "Minimum age is 55" },
    { date: "6 April 2028", change: "Minimum age rises to 57" },
    { date: "Future (TBC)", change: "May rise further (linked to SPA)" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Planning to Retire at 55?">
If you want to access your pension at 55, you must:
1. Be aged 55 before 6 April 2028
2. Start accessing your pension before that date

If you turn 55 after 5 April 2028, you'll need to wait until 57.

## Accessing Before Age 55

<Callout type="warning" title="Pension Scam Warning">
Anyone offering to help you access your pension before 55 (without a protected age) is likely a scammer. You could:

- Lose your entire pension
- Face tax charges up to 55%
- Have no recourse to recover funds

**Only access pensions through legitimate channels.**
</Callout>

There are very limited circumstances for early access:

  columns={[
    { key: "situation", header: "Situation" },
    { key: "age", header: "Access Age", highlight: true },
    { key: "notes", header: "Notes" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { situation: "Serious ill health", age: "Any age", notes: "Life expectancy under 12 months" },
    { situation: "Protected pension age", age: "Varies", notes: "Must have joined scheme pre-2006" },
    { situation: "Some old DB schemes", age: "50-55", notes: "Check scheme rules" }
