## Future: Born 1980s Onwards

<Callout type="info" title="Future State Pension Ages">
If you were born in the 1980s or later, your State Pension age is likely to be **68 or higher**, but this hasn't been set in law yet. The government reviews State Pension age regularly based on life expectancy data.

## Women: Historical Differences

<Callout type="info" title="Note for Women Born Before 1953">
Women's State Pension age was historically lower than men's (60 vs 65). This was gradually equalised between 2010-2018. If you're a woman born before 6 December 1953, your State Pension age was affected by this transition.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Why does my State Pension age depend on my birth date?",
      answer: "As life expectancy increases, the government adjusts State Pension age to ensure the pension system remains sustainable. People are living longer, so pension ages are rising."
    },
    {
      question: "Could my State Pension age change?",
      answer: "The increase to 67 is set in law and won't change. The proposed increase to 68 could be adjusted. Future reviews happen every 5-6 years."
    },
    {
      question: "I was born in 1960. Why is my SPA not exactly 66?",
      answer: "1960 is a transition year. The SPA rises gradually from 66 to 67 across 2026-2028. Your exact SPA depends on your birth month - it could be 66 years and several months."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find my exact State Pension age?",
      answer: "Use the official GOV.UK State Pension age calculator. Enter your exact date of birth to get your precise State Pension date."
