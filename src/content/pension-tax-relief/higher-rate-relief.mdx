## How Much Extra Can You Claim?

<Callout type="example" title="Higher Rate Example">
**You earn £60,000 and contribute £5,000 gross to your pension:**

**If using Relief at Source:**
- You paid: £4,000
- Provider claimed: £1,000 (20%)
- **You can claim extra: £1,000** (another 20%)
- **Real cost to you: £3,000**

**That's £5,000 in your pension for £3,000 out of pocket.**

## How to Claim

### Method 1: Self-Assessment Tax Return

<DataTable
  title="Self-Assessment Steps"
  columns={[
    { key: "step", header: "Step" },
    { key: "action", header: "Action", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { step: "1", action: "Log in to your HMRC online account" },
    { step: "2", action: "Go to your Self-Assessment tax return" },
    { step: "3", action: "Find 'Payments to registered pension schemes'" },
    { step: "4", action: "Enter your GROSS pension contributions" },
    { step: "5", action: "Relief calculated automatically" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Enter Gross Amount">
Enter the **gross** amount (what your pension received, including the 20% top-up), not the net amount you paid. For example:
- You paid: £800
- Pension received: £1,000
- Enter on tax return: **£1,000**
</Callout>

### Method 2: Contact HMRC (No Tax Return)

<DataTable
  title="Claiming Without Tax Return"
  columns={[
    { key: "method", header: "Method" },
    { key: "how", header: "How", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { method: "Phone", how: "Call HMRC Self-Assessment helpline" },
    { method: "Letter", how: "Write to HMRC with contribution details" },
    { method: "Online", how: "Claim via Government Gateway (simpler return)" }
  ]}
/>

### Method 3: Tax Code Adjustment

<Callout type="info" title="HMRC May Adjust Automatically">
If you claim higher rate relief regularly, HMRC may adjust your tax code to give you relief throughout the year (instead of a lump sum refund).

Check your tax code - codes with 'K' or higher numbers may already include pension relief.
</Callout>

## What If You Use Net Pay?

<DataTable
  title="Net Pay vs Relief at Source"
  columns={[
    { key: "method", header: "Your Pension Method" },
    { key: "claim", header: "Do You Need to Claim?", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { method: "Net Pay (workplace)", claim: "No - full relief automatic" },
    { method: "Relief at Source (SIPP/personal)", claim: "Yes - claim extra 20%/25%" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Check Your Payslip">
If pension contributions are shown as a deduction BEFORE tax, you have **net pay** and already receive full relief. No claim needed.

If you contribute to a SIPP or personal pension separately, that uses **relief at source** and you should claim the extra.
</Callout>

## Deadline for Claims

<DataTable
  title="Claim Deadlines"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Tax Year" },
    { key: "deadline", header: "Claim Deadline", highlight: true },
    { key: "status", header: "Status (Jan 2025)" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "2020/21", deadline: "5 April 2025", status: "Claim now!" },
    { year: "2021/22", deadline: "5 April 2026", status: "Still available" },
    { year: "2022/23", deadline: "5 April 2027", status: "Still available" },
    { year: "2023/24", deadline: "5 April 2028", status: "Still available" },
    { year: "2024/25", deadline: "5 April 2029", status: "Current year" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Check Past Years">
If you've contributed to a SIPP or personal pension as a higher rate taxpayer and never claimed the extra relief, you may be able to claim back **4 years** of missed relief. Could be worth thousands!

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much could I be owed?",
      answer: "If you've contributed £5,000/year gross for 4 years as a 40% taxpayer without claiming, you could be owed £4,000 (£1,000 per year × 4 years)."
    },
    {
      question: "Will claiming affect my benefits?",
      answer: "Pension tax relief claims don't directly affect means-tested benefits, but any resulting tax refund could temporarily affect benefits if it takes you over savings thresholds."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my employer claim for me?",
      answer: "No. If your workplace pension uses relief at source, you must claim the higher rate portion yourself. Employers only handle net pay arrangements."
    },
    {
      question: "What evidence do I need?",
      answer: "Your pension statements showing contributions. Keep these as HMRC may ask for proof. The statement should show gross amounts after the 20% top-up."
