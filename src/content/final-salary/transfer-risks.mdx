**Transferring a DB pension** to a defined contribution scheme is one of the biggest financial decisions you can make. Here's what you need to know.

## What Happens When You Transfer

  ]}

## Mandatory Financial Advice

<Callout type="warning" title="Legal Requirement">
For DB transfers with a value over **£30,000**, you must receive advice from a regulated financial adviser. This is a legal requirement - the pension scheme cannot process the transfer without proof of advice.

**Cost:** Typically £3,000-5,000+ for transfer advice.

## Partial Transfer

<Callout type="info" title="Partial Transfers">
Some DB schemes allow partial transfers - moving part of your benefits to a DC scheme while keeping some DB guarantees. This can provide:
- Some flexibility from DC portion
- Some security from DB portion
- Lower risk than full transfer

Ask your scheme if this option is available.
