## Can I Retire at 55?

Yes, if you have enough savings:

<Callout type="example" title="Retiring at 55">
**To retire at 55, you need to cover:**

- 11+ years before State Pension kicks in (age 66/67)
- All living expenses from private pensions only
- Healthcare, unexpected costs, inflation

**Rough calculation:**
- Need £25,000/year for 12 years = £300,000 minimum
- Plus buffer for inflation and emergencies
</Callout>

    },
    {
      question: "What's the earliest I can access my pension?",
      answer: "Private pensions: 55 (57 from 2028). State Pension: State Pension age only (currently 66). Some defined benefit schemes may have different rules."
    },

      question: "How do I know if I have enough to retire?",
      answer: "Add up your pension pots, calculate sustainable withdrawal (4% rule), add State Pension from SPA age, and compare to your expected expenses."
