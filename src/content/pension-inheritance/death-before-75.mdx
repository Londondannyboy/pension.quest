## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is there any tax at all if I die before 75?",
      answer: "For DC pensions (including SIPPs), no - it's completely tax-free if designated within 2 years. The beneficiary can take any amount without triggering income tax."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the 2-year deadline is missed?",
      answer: "If benefits aren't designated within 2 years, they're taxed as income when withdrawn. This makes the nomination form critically important."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my beneficiary keep the money invested?",
      answer: "Yes. They can transfer to a 'beneficiary drawdown' account and keep it invested tax-free. Withdrawals remain tax-free as long as you died before 75."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the £1,073,100 lifetime allowance affect this?",
      answer: "The lifetime allowance was abolished from April 2024. There are no allowance charges on pension death benefits."
