## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is there a maximum I can withdraw?",
      answer: "No. With flexi-access drawdown, you can withdraw any amount, even your entire pot. However, large withdrawals will be heavily taxed."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the MPAA and why does it matter?",
      answer: "The Money Purchase Annual Allowance (£10,000) limits future pension contributions after you've taken taxable drawdown income. This matters if you're still working and paying into a pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my mind after starting drawdown?",
      answer: "You can stop withdrawals, change amounts, or switch to an annuity. You can't 'undo' withdrawals already taken or reclaim unused tax-free cash entitlement."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to take my tax-free cash all at once?",
      answer: "No. You can crystallise your pot in stages, taking 25% tax-free from each portion. This is called phased drawdown."
