Understanding **pension transfer timescales** helps you plan and avoid frustration during the process.

## Typical Transfer Times

<DataTable
  title="Transfer Timescales"
  columns={[
    { key: "type", header: "Transfer Type" },
    { key: "typical", header: "Typical Time", highlight: true },
    { key: "max", header: "May Take Up To" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { type: "DC to DC (cash)", typical: "2-4 weeks", max: "8 weeks" },
    { type: "DC to DC (in-specie)", typical: "4-8 weeks", max: "12 weeks" },
    { type: "Workplace to SIPP", typical: "4-8 weeks", max: "12 weeks" },
    { type: "DB to DC (with advice)", typical: "3-4 months", max: "6+ months" },
    { type: "QROPS transfer", typical: "3-4 months", max: "6 months" }

## Cash vs In-Specie Transfers

<DataTable
  title="Transfer Methods"
  columns={[
    { key: "method", header: "Method" },
    { key: "how", header: "How It Works", highlight: true },
    { key: "time", header: "Time" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { method: "Cash transfer", how: "Investments sold, cash moved, reinvested", time: "Faster (2-4 weeks)" },
    { method: "In-specie transfer", how: "Investments moved without selling", time: "Slower (4-8+ weeks)" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="In-Specie Advantages">
In-specie transfers keep you invested throughout, avoiding:
- Being out of the market
- Potential dealing costs from selling/buying
- Having to recreate your portfolio

But they take longer and not all funds can transfer in-specie.

<Callout type="warning" title="Market Risk During Transfer">
During a cash transfer, your money is out of the market for potentially 1-3 weeks. If markets rise during this time, you miss out. If they fall, you benefit.

For large transfers, consider:
- In-specie transfer (stays invested)
- Transferring in tranches
- Timing when less concerned about market moves

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I speed up my pension transfer?",
      answer: "Have all information ready upfront (policy numbers, NI number). Respond quickly to any requests. Unfortunately, you're mostly dependent on the providers' processes."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the longest a transfer should take?",
      answer: "For DC pensions, transfers should complete within 12 weeks. DB transfers can legitimately take 6+ months due to advice requirements and scheme processes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel a transfer that's taking too long?",
      answer: "Yes, usually - contact your new provider. If money has already been sent, you'd need to transfer back, which takes more time."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my DB transfer taking so long?",
      answer: "DB transfers require regulated advice (3-6 weeks to arrange), CETV calculation (4-6 weeks), and scheme processing. The whole process commonly takes 4-6 months."
