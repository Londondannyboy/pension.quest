Transferring your pension is simpler than most people think. Here's exactly **how to transfer your pension**.

## Before You Start

<DataTable
  title="Information You'll Need"
  columns={[
    { key: "info", header: "Information" },
    { key: "where", header: "Where to Find It", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { info: "Old provider name", where: "Pension statements or payslips" },
    { info: "Policy/account number", where: "Pension statements" },
    { info: "National Insurance number", where: "P60, payslip, or HMRC letter" },
    { info: "Current value (helpful)", where: "Latest statement or online" },
    { info: "Old employer name (workplace)", where: "Records or payslips" }
  ]}
/>

## Step 1: Check Your Current Pension

<Callout type="info" title="What to Check">
Before transferring, verify:
- **Exit fees:** Some charge up to £300
- **Guaranteed benefits:** GAR, protected tax-free cash
- **Current charges:** What you're paying now
- **Fund performance:** How your pension has grown
</Callout>

<DataTable
  title="What Could Stop You"
  columns={[
    { key: "issue", header: "Issue" },
    { key: "action", header: "What to Do", highlight: true }
  ]}

    { issue: "High exit fee", action: "Calculate if transfer still worthwhile" },
    { issue: "Guaranteed annuity rate", action: "Usually keep the pension" },
    { issue: "Protected tax-free cash", action: "Understand what you'd lose" },
    { issue: "Ongoing employer contributions", action: "Don't transfer active scheme" }
  ]}
/>

## Step 2: Choose Your New Provider

  columns={[
    { key: "factor", header: "Factor" },
    { key: "what", header: "What to Compare", highlight: true }

    { factor: "Annual charges", what: "Platform fee + fund charges (aim <1%)" },
    { factor: "Investment choice", what: "Funds available, index trackers" },
    { factor: "Service", what: "Online access, app, customer service" },
    { factor: "Flexibility", what: "Drawdown options, lump sum access" },

## Step 4: Request the Transfer

<Callout type="info" title="You Do This Through Your NEW Provider">

- Old provider name
- Policy number
- Approximate value
</Callout>

    { key: "action", header: "Action" },
    { key: "who", header: "Who Does It", highlight: true }

    { action: "Process transfer", who: "Both providers" },
    { action: "Confirm completion", who: "New provider" }
  ]}
/>

    { type: "Workplace pension", typical: "4-8 weeks", max: "12 weeks" },
    { type: "DB pension", typical: "8-16 weeks", max: "6 months" }
  ]}
/>

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do I need to tell my old provider?",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my investments during transfer?",
      answer: "Usually, your investments are sold and transferred as cash. During this time (a few days to weeks), your money isn't invested in the market."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer part of my pension?",
      answer: "Some providers allow partial transfers; others require full transfer. Ask both providers before starting."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I change my mind?",
      answer: "Before completion, you can usually cancel. After the transfer completes, you'd need to transfer back (which takes time and may have costs)."
