Many employers contribute more than the minimum:

<Callout type="tip" title="Check Your Scheme">
Ask your HR department what matching is available. Many employees don't realise they could get more by increasing their own contributions slightly.

## Tax Benefits of Employer Contributions

<DataTable
  title="Why Employer Contributions Are So Valuable"
  columns={[
    { key: "benefit", header: "Tax Benefit" },
    { key: "explanation", header: "What This Means", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { benefit: "No Income Tax", explanation: "You don't pay tax on employer contributions" },
    { benefit: "No National Insurance", explanation: "Neither you nor employer pays NI on these" },
    { benefit: "Corporation Tax relief", explanation: "Employer gets tax relief, so they cost less to provide" },
    { benefit: "No personal Annual Allowance use", explanation: "Employer contributions don't count towards your £60,000 limit*" }
  ]}
  caption="*They count towards a combined employer/employee Annual Allowance."
/>

<Callout type="example" title="Salary vs Pension Contribution">
Your employer has £1,000 to spend on you:

**As salary:**
- Employer NI: -£138
- Your Income Tax (40%): -£345
- Your NI: -£21
- **You receive**: ~£496

**As pension contribution:**
- No employer NI
- No Income Tax
- No employee NI
- **In your pension**: £1,000

Pension contributions are worth **twice as much** for higher-rate taxpayers!

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What's the maximum employer can contribute?",
      answer: "There's no legal maximum, but employer contributions count towards the Annual Allowance (£60,000 combined with your contributions). Very high earners may have a tapered allowance."
    },
    {
      question: "Do employer contributions appear on my payslip?",
      answer: "Usually yes, as a separate line. They don't reduce your gross pay but are shown as an addition to your pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I negotiate higher employer contributions?",
      answer: "Sometimes, especially for senior roles. Pension contributions are often more tax-efficient than salary increases for both parties."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my employer doesn't offer matching?",
      answer: "The minimum 3% still applies. You can still increase your own contributions and get tax relief, even without employer matching."
    },
    {
      question: "Do employer contributions continue during maternity leave?",
      answer: "Yes, employer must continue contributing at the normal rate based on your pre-leave salary during paid maternity leave."
    }
