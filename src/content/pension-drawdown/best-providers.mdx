    },
    {
      question: "Do all providers offer the same investments?",

      answer: "Your investments are held separately from the provider. You're also protected by FSCS up to £85,000 for investment failures."
    },
    {
      question: "Is cheapest always best?",
      answer: "Not necessarily. Consider service, tools, and investment choice alongside costs. The right provider for you balances all these factors."
