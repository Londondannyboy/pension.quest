## The Pension Cold Call Ban

<Callout type="info" title="Cold Calls Are Illegal">
Since January 2019, **pension cold calls are illegal**. If someone calls you out of the blue about your pension:

1. **Hang up immediately**
2. Don't give any personal information
3. Report to FCA and ICO
4. Tell friends and family

Legitimate companies do not cold call about pensions.

  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How do scammers get my details?",

    {
      question: "Can I get my money back if scammed?",

    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm already partway through a transfer?",
      answer: "Stop immediately if you have concerns. Contact your existing pension provider - they may be able to halt or reverse the transfer. Get independent advice before proceeding."
    },
    {
      question: "Are text messages and emails about pensions also scams?",
      answer: "Unsolicited contact by any method (call, text, email, social media) about pensions should be treated as potential scams. Legitimate providers only contact existing customers."
