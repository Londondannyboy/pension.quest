## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What is the SIPP contribution limit?",
      answer: "The Annual Allowance is £60,000 for 2024/25. This is the maximum you can contribute across all pensions and receive tax relief. Higher earners may have a reduced tapered allowance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take money out before 55?",
      answer: "Only if you're seriously ill or have a protected lower pension age from an older scheme. Otherwise, accessing before 55 (57 from 2028) isn't possible and attempts to do so may be a pension scam."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I exceed the Annual Allowance?",
      answer: "You'll face an Annual Allowance charge - effectively the tax relief is clawed back. You may be able to use carry forward from previous years to avoid this."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any contribution limits for over 75s?",
      answer: "Since April 2024, there's no age limit for pension contributions or tax relief, as long as you have UK earnings."
