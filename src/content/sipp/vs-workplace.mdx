## The Golden Rule

<Callout type="warning" title="Employer Match First!">
**Always** contribute enough to your workplace pension to get the full employer match before putting money in a SIPP. Employer contributions are free money - typically 3-8% of your salary.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Should I opt out of workplace pension for a SIPP?",
      answer: "Almost never. You'd lose free employer contributions. Even if your workplace scheme has limited options or higher fees, the employer contribution usually outweighs these downsides."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer workplace pension to SIPP?",
      answer: "Usually only after leaving that employer. While employed, your current workplace pension typically can't be transferred. Old workplace pensions can usually be transferred."
    },
    {
      question: "Which has lower fees?",
      answer: "It varies. Large employers often negotiate low workplace pension fees. Some low-cost SIPPs (like Vanguard) may be cheaper than some workplace schemes. Compare your specific options."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a SIPP if I have a good workplace pension?",
      answer: "Not necessarily. If you're happy with your workplace pension's investment options and you're contributing enough for retirement, a SIPP may not add value. It's useful if you want more control or choice."
