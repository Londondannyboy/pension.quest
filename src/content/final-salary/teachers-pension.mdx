This can help transition to full retirement or manage workload.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is the Teachers' Pension worth it?",
      answer: "Absolutely. With a 28.68% employer contribution and guaranteed income for life, it's exceptionally valuable. The only comparable schemes are other public sector pensions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I opt out?",
      answer: "You can, but losing the 28.68% employer contribution is essentially a massive pay cut in pension terms. It's almost never advisable unless you have very specific circumstances."
    },
    {
      question: "What's my Normal Pension Age?",
      answer: "For 2015 scheme: your State Pension Age (check GOV.UK). For NPA 60 section: 60. For NPA 65 section: 65. Many teachers have benefits across sections."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my TPS pension?",
      answer: "You can request a transfer value, but transferring is rarely advisable. You'd give up guaranteed inflation-linked income for life in exchange for a lump sum."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I leave teaching?",
      answer: "Your pension is preserved (deferred). It increases with CPI until you claim it. You can take it from age 55 with reductions, or wait until NPA for full pension."
