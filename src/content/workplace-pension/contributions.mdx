  "You pay at least 5%, employer pays at least 3%",

Understanding **workplace pension contributions** helps you maximise your retirement savings. Here's how the contribution system works.

## Minimum Contribution Rates

<DataTable
  title="Minimum Contribution Rates (2024/25)"
  columns={[
    { key: "who", header: "Who Pays" },
    { key: "minimum", header: "Minimum Rate", highlight: true },
    { key: "includes", header: "Includes" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { who: "Employee", minimum: "5%", includes: "Tax relief included in the 5%" },
    { who: "Employer", minimum: "3%", includes: "Paid on top of your salary" },
    { who: "Total", minimum: "8%", includes: "Combined contribution" }
  ]}
/>

### What Are Qualifying Earnings?

Contributions are based on **qualifying earnings** - your earnings between two thresholds:

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard
    label="Lower Threshold"
    value="£6,240"
    change="per year (£520/month)"
    icon="📉"
    color="blue"
  />
  <StatCard
    label="Upper Threshold"
    value="£50,270"
    change="per year (£4,189/month)"
    icon="📈"
    color="emerald"
  />
</StatGrid>

<Callout type="example" title="How Qualifying Earnings Work">
**Tom** earns £32,000 per year:

- Qualifying earnings = £32,000 - £6,240 = **£25,760**
- His 5% contribution = £25,760 × 5% = **£1,288/year**
- Employer 3% contribution = £25,760 × 3% = **£773/year**
- **Total annual contribution: £2,061**
</Callout>

## Employer Contribution Matching

Many employers offer to **match** your contributions up to a certain level:

<DataTable
  title="Common Matching Structures"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme Type" },
    { key: "you", header: "You Pay" },
    { key: "employer", header: "Employer Pays", highlight: true },
    { key: "total", header: "Total" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scheme: "Minimum legal", you: "5%", employer: "3%", total: "8%" },
    { scheme: "1:1 match up to 5%", you: "5%", employer: "5%", total: "10%" },
    { scheme: "1:1 match up to 6%", you: "6%", employer: "6%", total: "12%" },
    { scheme: "2:1 match", you: "4%", employer: "8%", total: "12%" },
    { scheme: "Fixed employer", you: "5%", employer: "10%", total: "15%" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Always Get the Full Match!">
If your employer matches contributions, **always contribute enough to get the full match**. It's literally free money. Not doing so is like turning down a pay rise.

## Tax Relief on Contributions

Your pension contributions receive tax relief:

  columns={[
    { key: "band", header: "Tax Band" },
    { key: "relief", header: "Tax Relief", highlight: true },
    { key: "cost", header: "Cost of £100 in Pension" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { band: "Basic rate (20%)", relief: "20%", cost: "£80" },
    { band: "Higher rate (40%)", relief: "40%", cost: "£60" },
    { band: "Additional rate (45%)", relief: "45%", cost: "£55" }
  ]}
  caption="20% relief is automatic. Higher rate relief claimed via self-assessment."

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I pay more than the minimum?",
      answer: "Yes! You can usually increase your contributions through your employer's payroll. Some employers will match additional contributions, giving you even more free money."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I earn under £6,240?",
      answer: "No minimum contributions apply, but you can still join your workplace pension. Your employer may not have to contribute if you're an 'entitled worker' rather than an 'eligible jobholder'."
    },
    {
      question: "Are employer contributions taxed?",
      answer: "No. Employer pension contributions are not taxed as income and don't use up your personal Annual Allowance (up to £60,000). They're a very tax-efficient benefit."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I reduce my contributions?",
      answer: "You can reduce to the minimum levels (or opt out entirely), but you shouldn't go below your employer's matching level without good reason - you'd be giving up free money."
    },
    {
      question: "Do contributions come from my gross or net salary?",
      answer: "Most workplace pensions use 'relief at source' where contributions come from net pay, then tax relief is added. Some use 'net pay' arrangements where contributions are deducted before tax."
