## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How accurate are annuity calculators?",
      answer: "They provide estimates only. Actual rates depend on your exact circumstances and change daily. Always get personalised quotes from providers."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do annuity rates improve with age?",
      answer: "Because older people have shorter life expectancy, the insurer expects to pay for fewer years, so they can afford to pay more per year."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I wait to buy an annuity?",
      answer: "Possibly. Rates improve with age. Many use drawdown early in retirement and buy an annuity later when rates are better and security becomes more important."
