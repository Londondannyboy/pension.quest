<Callout type="info" title="The Magic Number">
If your pot earns more than you withdraw (after inflation), it can last indefinitely. A 6% return with 4% withdrawal leaves 2% real growth.

## Including State Pension

<Callout type="example" title="Total Retirement Income">
**Margaret**, 66, has a £250,000 pension pot:

**Drawdown at 4%:**
- Private pension income: £10,000/year
- State Pension: £11,500/year
- **Total income: £21,500/year**

This puts her in the "Moderate" retirement living standard (PLSA).

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What is a safe withdrawal rate?",
      answer: "The '4% rule' is a common guideline - withdraw 4% in year one, then adjust for inflation. For a 30-year retirement, this has historically had a high success rate. For longer retirements, consider 3-3.5%."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I take income or lump sums?",
      answer: "Regular income is easier to budget. Lump sums suit one-off needs. Many people combine both. Consider tax efficiency - large lump sums may push you into higher tax bands."
    },
    {
      question: "How do charges affect my pot?",
      answer: "Charges reduce your effective return. 1% in charges on a £200k pot = £2,000/year. Choose low-cost funds to maximise what stays in your pot."
    },
    {
      question: "What if markets crash early in retirement?",
      answer: "This is 'sequence of returns risk'. Early losses combined with withdrawals can permanently damage your pot. Keep some money in cash/bonds to avoid selling in down markets."
