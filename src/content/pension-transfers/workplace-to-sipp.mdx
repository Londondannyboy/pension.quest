## What About DB Workplace Pensions?

<Callout type="warning" title="DB Pensions Different">
If your workplace pension is a **defined benefit** scheme (final salary or career average), very different rules apply:

- Must take financial advice if transfer value >£30,000
- Advice typically costs £3,000-5,000+
- Transfer is rarely recommended
- You'd give up guaranteed income for life

This page covers **defined contribution** workplace pensions only.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Will I pay tax on the transfer?",
      answer: "No. Pension-to-pension transfers are tax-free. You only pay tax when you withdraw money from your pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my employer stop me transferring?",
      answer: "No. You have the right to transfer your pension. However, transferring an active scheme will stop employer contributions - so wait until you leave."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't know how to invest?",
      answer: "Many SIPPs offer ready-made portfolios or model portfolios. You can also use simple global index funds. You don't need to pick individual stocks."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the transfer take?",
      answer: "Typically 4-8 weeks for workplace DC to SIPP. Some schemes are faster, some slower. During transfer, you're out of the market."
