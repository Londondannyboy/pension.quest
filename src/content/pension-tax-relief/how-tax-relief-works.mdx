## Relief at Source: Detailed

<Callout type="example" title="Relief at Source Example">
**You want to put £100 into your pension:**

1. You pay **£80** to your pension provider
2. Provider claims **£20** from HMRC
3. Your pension receives **£100**

**If you're a higher rate (40%) taxpayer:**
4. Claim extra **£20** via self-assessment
5. Received as tax refund or reduced tax bill
6. **Real cost to you: £60**
</Callout>

    { step: "Claim higher rate (extra 20%)", who: "You via self-assessment", when: "After tax year end" },
    { step: "Claim additional rate (extra 25%)", who: "You via self-assessment", when: "After tax year end" }
  ]}

## Net Pay: Detailed

<Callout type="example" title="Net Pay Example">
**You earn £3,000/month gross and contribute 5% (£150):**

1. Employer deducts **£150** before calculating tax
2. You're taxed on **£2,850** instead of £3,000
3. At 40% tax, you save **£60** immediately
4. Your pension receives **£150**

**No self-assessment needed** - full relief is automatic.

## Which Method Does Your Pension Use?

  columns={[
    { key: "pension", header: "Pension Type" },
    { key: "likely", header: "Likely Method", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { pension: "SIPP", likely: "Relief at Source" },
    { pension: "Personal pension", likely: "Relief at Source" },
    { pension: "NEST", likely: "Relief at Source" },
    { pension: "Large workplace scheme", likely: "Net Pay" },
    { pension: "NHS Pension", likely: "Net Pay" },
    { pension: "Teachers' Pension", likely: "Net Pay" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="How to Check">
Look at your payslip:
- **Net Pay:** Pension is shown as a deduction BEFORE tax is calculated
- **Relief at Source:** Pension is shown AFTER net pay, or not shown at all

Or: Does your pension statement show 20% added by HMRC? That's relief at source.
</Callout>

## Claiming Higher Rate Relief

<DataTable
  title="How to Claim Extra Relief"
  columns={[
    { key: "method", header: "Method" },
    { key: "when", header: "When to Use", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { method: "Self-assessment tax return", when: "If you file a return anyway" },
    { method: "Call/write to HMRC", when: "If you don't file a return" },
    { method: "Adjust tax code", when: "HMRC may do this automatically" },
    { method: "Online (pension scheme contributions)", when: "Via Government Gateway" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't Miss Your Claim">
You can only claim higher rate relief going back **4 tax years**. If you've been contributing to a relief at source pension and haven't claimed, check past years now!
</Callout>

## Net Pay and Low Earners

<Callout type="warning" title="Net Pay Trap">
If you earn below the personal allowance (£12,570) and your pension uses **net pay**, you don't benefit from tax relief because you weren't paying tax anyway.

With **relief at source**, you'd still get the 20% government top-up.

This is called the "Net Pay Anomaly" - millions of low earners miss out.

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do I get double tax relief if I claim via self-assessment?",
      answer: "No. If your pension uses net pay, you've already had full relief. Only relief at source pensions require self-assessment claims for higher rate relief."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't file a self-assessment return?",
      answer: "You can still claim higher rate relief by writing to HMRC or calling them. You can also claim online via the Government Gateway."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I've already claimed?",
      answer: "Check your self-assessment return for 'Payments to registered pension schemes' section. Or check if HMRC adjusted your tax code for pension relief."
    },
    {
      question: "What about Scottish taxpayers?",
      answer: "Scottish income tax rates differ (19%, 20%, 21%, 42%, 47%). Relief at source still adds 20%, but the extra claim depends on your Scottish rate. Higher rates may need to claim more."
