## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How are workplace pension contributions calculated?",
      answer: "Contributions are based on 'qualifying earnings' - your earnings between £6,240 and £50,270. The minimum is 8% total (5% from you, 3% from employer) of this amount."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my contribution different from my colleague's?",
      answer: "Contributions depend on salary and whether you've increased above the minimum. Some employers also offer different matching levels to different groups."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my salary changes?",
      answer: "Your contributions will automatically adjust with your salary changes. Higher salary = higher qualifying earnings = higher contributions."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are pension calculators?",
      answer: "They provide estimates based on assumptions about growth rates, inflation, and charges. Actual results will vary. Use them as a guide, not a guarantee."
