A **pension annuity** gives you guaranteed income for life in exchange for your pension pot. It's one of the main ways to turn your savings into retirement income.

## What is an Annuity?

An annuity is an insurance product. You give an insurance company your pension pot, and they promise to pay you a fixed income for the rest of your life - no matter how long you live.

5. **Consider advice** - For larger pots, advice may be worthwhile

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I change my annuity after buying?",
      answer: "No, annuities are generally irreversible. Once you've exchanged your pot for an annuity, you can't change the terms or get your money back. Choose carefully."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my annuity when I die?",
      answer: "With single life, it stops. With joint life, your partner continues receiving income. A guarantee period ensures payments continue to your estate for a set time even if you die early."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I buy an annuity or use drawdown?",
      answer: "Many people use both. An annuity provides a secure baseline income; drawdown offers flexibility. Consider using part of your pot for each."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I buy an annuity?",
      answer: "Annuity rates improve with age. Many people use drawdown in early retirement and buy an annuity later (70s/80s) when rates are better and security becomes more important."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to buy an annuity?",
      answer: "No, it's your choice. You can use drawdown, take cash lump sums, or combine approaches. Annuities are one option, not a requirement."
