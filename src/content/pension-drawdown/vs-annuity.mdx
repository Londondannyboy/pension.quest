## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I switch from drawdown to annuity?",
      answer: "Yes, you can buy an annuity with your remaining drawdown pot at any time. Annuity rates improve with age, so some people use drawdown first then annuitise later."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch from annuity to drawdown?",
      answer: "No. Once you buy an annuity, it's irreversible. This is why many people start with drawdown and consider annuity later."
    },
    {
      question: "Which is better financially?",
      answer: "It depends on how long you live and investment returns. If you live a long time and markets are poor, annuity wins. If markets are good or you die earlier, drawdown may have been better. There's no way to know in advance."
    },
    {
      question: "What about inflation?",
      answer: "Drawdown income can increase if your pot grows. Level annuities lose buying power to inflation. Inflation-linked annuities start lower but maintain value. Consider your inflation protection needs."
