## Example Pension Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="2015 Scheme Example">
**Maria, Band 6 Nurse**
- Pensionable pay: £38,000/year
- Service: 25 years (all in 2015 scheme)

**Annual pension (simplified):**
£38,000 × 25 × 1/54 = **£17,593/year**

*In practice, each year's pension builds at that year's salary, revalued to retirement.*

**Plus:**
- Pension increases annually with inflation
- Paid for Maria's lifetime
- Spouse receives 50% if Maria dies
- Can take 25% as tax-free lump sum

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is the NHS Pension worth it?",
      answer: "Absolutely. With a 23.7% employer contribution and guaranteed inflation-linked income for life, it's one of the most valuable pensions available. Very few private sector schemes come close."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I opt out of the NHS Pension?",
      answer: "You can, but it's almost never advisable. You'd lose the 23.7% employer contribution - essentially a 23.7% pay cut on your pension benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the NHS Pension Annual Allowance issue?",
      answer: "High earners (consultants, senior managers) may exceed the £60,000 annual allowance, triggering tax charges. This is a complex area - seek specialist advice if affected."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I buy added years or additional pension?",
      answer: "Yes, you can purchase Additional Pension in the 2015 scheme. This can boost your retirement income, and contributions get tax relief."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I leave the NHS?",
      answer: "Your pension is preserved (deferred). It will increase with inflation until you claim it. You can also transfer it to a new employer's scheme (but rarely advisable)."
