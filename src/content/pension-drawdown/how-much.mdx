**How much can you withdraw?** Technically, as much as you want. But how much *should* you withdraw? That's the key question.

## Withdrawal Rate Guidelines

  columns={[
    { key: "rate", header: "Rate" },
    { key: "risk", header: "Risk Level", highlight: true },
    { key: "suitable", header: "May Suit" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rate: "3%", risk: "Low", suitable: "Very cautious, long retirement" },
    { rate: "4%", risk: "Moderate", suitable: "Most retirees (the '4% rule')" },
    { rate: "5%", risk: "Higher", suitable: "Shorter time horizon" },
    { rate: "6%+", risk: "High", suitable: "Very short horizon or other income" }

## What the 4% Rule Means

<Callout type="example" title="4% Rule in Practice">
**Your pot: £300,000**

Year 1: £300,000 × 4% = **£12,000**
Year 2: £12,000 × 1.02 (inflation) = **£12,240**
Year 3: £12,240 × 1.02 = **£12,485**

Continue adjusting for inflation each year.

This has historically given a 90%+ chance of lasting 30 years.

## Don't Forget State Pension

<Callout type="tip" title="Total Picture">
Your drawdown isn't your only income. Add State Pension (£11,500+ at full rate) for your total retirement income.

**Example: £200k pot + State Pension**
- Drawdown at 4%: £8,000
- State Pension: £11,500
- **Total: £19,500/year**

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is there a maximum I can withdraw?",
      answer: "No legal maximum. You could take your entire pot in one go (though that would be heavily taxed and generally unwise)."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need more some years?",
      answer: "Drawdown is flexible. You can take more when needed and less in other years. Just watch your overall withdrawal rate over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include my tax-free cash in calculations?",
      answer: "The 25% tax-free is separate. The withdrawal rates above apply to the remaining 75% of your pot that's in drawdown."
    },
    {
      question: "What about inflation?",
      answer: "Increase your withdrawals each year with inflation to maintain buying power. This is built into the 4% rule."
    }
