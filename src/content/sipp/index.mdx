## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a SIPP and a pension?",
      answer: "A SIPP is a type of pension. The difference is investment choice - a SIPP lets you choose from thousands of investments, while most pensions offer limited fund options."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a SIPP worth it?",
      answer: "For investors who want control and are willing to manage their investments, yes. If you prefer simplicity or have small pots, a standard pension may be more suitable."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my workplace pension to a SIPP?",
      answer: "Usually yes, once you've left that employer. Be careful with defined benefit pensions - you must take advice if the transfer value exceeds £30,000."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the maximum I can put in a SIPP?",
      answer: "You can contribute up to £60,000 per year (or 100% of earnings if lower) and receive tax relief. This is the Annual Allowance, shared across all your pensions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have a SIPP and a workplace pension?",
      answer: "Yes! Many people contribute to their workplace pension (to get employer matching) and also save in a SIPP for more investment control."
    },
    {
      question: "Are SIPP contributions tax deductible?",
      answer: "Yes, SIPP contributions receive tax relief. Basic-rate relief is added automatically. Higher/additional-rate taxpayers claim extra relief through self-assessment."
    }
