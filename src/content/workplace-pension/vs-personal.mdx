## When Personal Pension Makes Sense

  columns={[
    { key: "situation", header: "Situation" },
    { key: "reason", header: "Why Personal Pension", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { situation: "Self-employed", reason: "No employer to provide workplace pension" },
    { situation: "Maxed employer match", reason: "Already getting full employer contributions" },
    { situation: "Want more control", reason: "Need specific investment options (SIPP)" },
    { situation: "Multiple income sources", reason: "Want to consolidate in one place" },
    { situation: "Contractor/freelancer", reason: "May not have workplace scheme access" }

/>

## The Best Strategy

For most employed people:

1. **First**: Contribute enough to get full employer match
2. **Then**: Consider increasing workplace contributions further
3. **Finally**: Add a personal pension (SIPP) for extra control/flexibility

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I have both a workplace and personal pension?",
      answer: "Yes! Many people contribute to their workplace pension for the employer match, then add extra to a personal pension (like a SIPP) for more investment choice."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I opt out of workplace to pay into personal pension?",
      answer: "Almost never. You'd be giving up free employer contributions. It's rarely worth losing 3%+ of your salary just for more investment choice."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a SIPP better than a workplace pension?",
      answer: "A SIPP offers more control, but doesn't come with employer contributions. Get your full employer match first, then consider a SIPP for additional savings."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my employer's scheme has high charges?",
      answer: "Even with higher charges, the employer contribution usually outweighs them. Contribute enough for the full match, then consider a personal pension for extra savings."
